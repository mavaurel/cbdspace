  "title": "CBD Dosage Guide. How much should I take?",
  "content": "The CBD fame has already spread across the globe. Various products, such as oils, \\[Tooltip]tinctures\\[Tooltip], creams, vape liquids, and different edibles are ready for consumers to buy. CBD became a mainstream pretty rapidly due to its hopeful therapeutic properties and the changes in a federal law of the United States. \n\n[A 2018 farm bill](https://cbdspace.io/2018-farm-bill-and-what-it-means-for-cbd-industry/) played a key role in CBD escalation on the market, because it says that from now it is legal to produce and sell hemp plant, but only if you are a licensed grower and the amount of THC in your plants isn’t more than 0.3%. Otherwise, if you try to grow without a license and sell anything, it is completely illegal. \n\nMoreover, you should be aware of your state laws, that might still change to be sure that even using CBD in your area is legal. If you already decided to try CBD in a certain form, the next step will be figuring out what is the ideal dosage for you. But how to do it properly? That’s the topic of our discussion for today, but firstly we should get through the commons of CBD if you are still unfamiliar with it. Let’s start with the simplest question - what is CBD and how does it work?\n\n## What is CBD?\n\nGenerally speaking, CBD is one of the major compounds found in cannabis plant and stands short for cannabidiol. Unlike his nearest cousin, THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, CBD cannot get to the “high” state no matter how much you use because it works other way. \n\nThe absence of any psychoactivity and quite similar therapeutic properties to THC gives it a great opportunity to become a standalone treatment for severe issues like anxiety, depression, some forms of pain, epilepsy, heart-related problems and much more. However, scientist still did not discover the full potential of CBD for medical use and there are a lot of studies that are in progress. \n\nAs for now, you may use your CBD differently. For example, you can use it sublingual way, by dropping special tinctures under your tongue, or inhaling CBD infused liquids with your vape, or even commonly eat infused edibles and pills. Okay, this is clear, but how does it work?\n\nIt is a good question. Every one of us has an endocannabinoid system(ECS), which is a complex of receptors giving signals to our body and produces cannabinoids to maintain \\[Tooltip]homeostasis\\[Tooltip] and our overall wellness. The ECS is responsible for regulation of many functions in our body: immunity, mood, memory, appetite, etc. For example, the thing known as “runner’s high” is a result of working ECS. \n\nEndocannabinoid system has receptors, that either CBD or THC interact with, CB1 and CB2. Unlike THC, CBD due to its shape doesn’t try to replace our natural \\[Tooltip]neurotransmitters\\[Tooltip] called anandamide, but just binds to these receptors producing much more cannabinoids to maintain our natural body rhythms. The exact ways of how CB1 and CB2 receptors affect on our brains isn’t fully understood so there are still more to study and research. Let’s get to some studies and try to figure out how CBD may benefit your personal health!\n\n## How CBD may benefit me? Is there any studies?\n\nCBD is being a subject of many researches and discussion since it is legal on the territory of the United States. There is a kind of summing up research<sup id=\"ref_1\">[1](#note_1)</sup> showing what we already know about CBD and how it may benefit your health. Simply put, here are some conditions that CBD may be used to treat or become a supplement:\n\n* [Pain and Inflammation](https://cbdspace.io/does-cbd-help-with-pain/);\n* [Anxiety and Depression](https://cbdspace.io/does-cbd-work-for-anxiety/);\n* Heart and circulatory system;\n* Acne Reduce;\n* Drug addiction and withdrawal;\n* Cancer-related problems;\n* Insomnia.\n\nAnd it is only a matter of time before we discover its full potential. To the moment it is clear, that CBD is relatively safe and doesn’t have any crucial side effects, but you should be aware that it may interact with your daily medication. \n\nComing to the dosage point, we may say, that according to the research listed upper, there is no one universal dose of CBD for a person. It is pretty individual for every person and the amount of CBD consumed daily may vary from 20 to 1500 milligrams(mg) according to studies. The next question is, how to know what amount of CBD would be good for you?\n\n## How to find out the optimal CBD dosage for you?\n\nAny CBD dose or a product choice depend on several key factors:\n\n* Your overall weight\n* Individual chemistry of your body\n* Condition you are treating\n* Amount of CBD in any product.\n\nSimply put, there is a lot to look at before choosing any product for yourself, many varieties of what to pick and how to use it. It is recommended to talk with your doctor or pharmacist first, because only a specialist can consider all the potential risks and decide how much CBD you should use. \n\nHowever, not all the doctors are familiar with CBD these days. In that case, it’s best to start with small amounts of CBD, 20 to 40 mg a day, for example, and the increasing by 5 week after week. If you don’t feel any effect in time, it is not a tragedy at all. Remember, this is a very precise way and you shouldn’t try to do it quicker by enhancing your dose. All this depends on a very relative factors, so it would be better to listen to your body in order to do things right. \n\nIt might be also helpful to you to track all the CBD you use, so you can make some conclusions after using certain product. Due to its high individuality, it may become a kind of experiment, so be sure to consider all the facts and do your research slowly and accurately. If you will follow these common tips, the results won’t be bad for sure, and you will be surely informed whether CBD is good for you personally.\n\n## How to calculate your primary dosage of CBD?\n\nAs we have mentioned before, choosing your optimal dosage depends not only on how much you weight or the condition you treat, but also on a certain amount of CBD in any product you take. For example, several CBD product like gummies or pills tell you how much CBD you are going to consume with a single serving. \n\nIt might be labeled, that there is a 10 mg per [capsule](https://cbdspace.io/cbd-capsules-the-essential-guide/) or gummy in the bottle so it is gonna be rather easier for you to track how much you consume. If you use a so called CBD tincture, it comes in a dropper bottle, and the label may say how much of CBD is in a single drop, but as it usually is, there is a total amount of CBD listed on the label. \n\nFrom that point, what should I do to know how much CBD is consumed? There’s nothing to worry about. Let’s do the simple maths. One drop is about 0.05 milliliters (ml). This means that a 10 ml bottle of CBD oil contains 200 drops. And if the label on that 10 ml bottle says that the bottle contains 1000 mg of CBD, each drop will contain about 5 mg of CBD. So, to have 20 mg of that form of CBD oil, you should take four drops. But what if I’m gonna mess it up and take much more CBD than I wanted to, could it make me overdose?\n\n## Is it possible to overdose with CBD?\n\nThe answer is pretty simple - no, you cannot overdose with CBD! According to some researches, even taking high doses(around 1500 mg a day) of CBD continuously, it is still gonna be well tolerated by your body. There is also a study done on rats saying that there might be a potential for liver damage, but that is not a final verdict. Even though CBD cannot cause any critical damage, there are still some temporary side effects like diarrhea, fatigue, changes in appetite, and the possibility to [interact](https://cbdspace.io/cbd-and-drug-interactions-is-it-dangerous/) with your other daily medication.\n\nNonetheless, you should be aware of the fact, that CBD isn’t regulated greatly at the moment, so the FDA(Food and Drug Administration) recommends you to buy and consume only licensed brands, that met with some certification process and \\[Tooltip]third-party lab testing\\[Tooltip] in order to be sure in your products safety and even legality. That’s all may become pretty dangerous if you are gonna buy fake or low quality product, or the one with inaccurate labeling, so check everything twice before you spend the money.\n\n## Go visit your doctor or pharmacist instead of reading this!\n\nAfter all you have read we still recommend you to do your best and visit your doctor first, even though he is not pretty familiar with CBD. Consider the fact, that your pharmacist may be able to provide correct information on an optimal dosage or brands you should keep your eye on, especially if you are currently using any medication.\n\n## Bottom line.\n\nAny information on CBD we share with you, is not a strong recommendation or an advice, we just want you to keep in mind the facts that might be useful and help you with some doubts in your mind on a certain topic connected with CBD. Always remember to talk with a specialist before doing anything. We hope that this article will be handy for either of your research. Stay tuned and don’t forget to share if you like.",
