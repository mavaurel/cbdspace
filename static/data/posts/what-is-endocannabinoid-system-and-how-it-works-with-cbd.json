  "content": "As it is known, hemp plant has been our dear friend since the dawn of time. It has been used since the second century in many different industries starting with fabric and ending with health and beauty. You are probably questioning yourself, why is it so popular right now? The truth is, hemp plant is about everything, but for now people are enjoying [benefits](https://cbdspace.io/cbd-benefits-and-side-effects/) of hemp as a natural supplement, and not the plant itself, but the marvellous hemp compounds called cannabinoids.\n\nSince the [2018 farm bill](https://cbdspace.io/2018-farm-bill-and-what-it-means-for-cbd-industry/) came in, the hemp and its products manufacturing became completelylegal on the territory of the United States(but only for licensed growers, and if the amount of THC in the plant does not exceed 0.3%). After that, society became almost obsessed with natural benefits that plant gives. The most popular part of the plant nowadays is CBD, or cannabidiol, which is a natural compound found in cannabis plant. It’s been discovered by scientists not so long ago, and its mind blowing potential gave a shot to numerous tests and scientific researches.\n\nThe most interesting thing about CBD is the fact, that compound isn’t psychoactive at all, unlike its nearest cousin \\[Tooltip]THC\\[Tooltip], which is the primary psychoactive part of cannabis. While many people are interested in CBD and how itis [used](https://cbdspace.io/what-are-the-uses-of-cbd-will-it-work-for-me/), we decided to observe one of the most important topics around - how CBD interacts with your body, and what is endocannabinoid system? So, what is endocannabinoid system and how does it work?\n\n## What is endocannabinoid system?\n\nFirst things first, we need to learn how our bodies work in order to understand how other substances interact with them. Every human being on earth has a system deep down his\\her body called endocannabinoid system, or ECS. It exists to support our overall wellness and proper work of other body systems like immune, nervous, cardiovascular, etc.\n\nWhen all these systems function on a positive level, you can feel yourself healthy and balanced, and your body maintains \\[Tooltip]homeostasis\\[Tooltip].\n\nEndocannabinoid system was discovered by scientists in 1990’s. Simply put, ECS produces cannabis-like molecules called endocannabinoids on its own, and the system also includes receptors which interact with cannabinoids. The main job of this system is to maintain harmony between all the body parts called homeostasis, and regulate proper work of other systems in your body.\n\nIt was explored, that endocannabinoid system is one of the most widespread systems in our bodies, and it affects almost every other body parts. It is known for now, that endocannabinoid receptors can be found in many body areas: immune cells, skin, brains, blood vessels, gut, liver, etc.\n\nAs for now, when we have already learned the basics, it is time to talk about particular things. First of all, what are the endocannabinoids and how it is different from cannabinoids we consume?\n\n## What are the endocannabinoids?\n\nEndocannabinoids, or endogenous cannabinoids, are molecules that are pretty similar to cannabinoids you may consume, but only with one difference - they are being produced by our bodies. To the moment, there are two key endocannabinoids discovered by scientists - Anandamide(AEA), and [Tooltip]2-AG[Tooltip].\n\nYour bodies produce these endocannabinoids in order to maintain proper levels and functioning of other internal systems. Speaking simply, if our bodies for any reasons can’t produce proper amounts of endocannabinoids, we start using cannabinoids like CBD to help our internal systems get in the normal state.\n\nWhat about these endocannabinoid receptors? What do they do, and why are they so widespread through our bodies?\n\n## What are the endocannabinoid receptors and enzymes?\n\nThis kind of receptors are located throughout all your body. There are two main endocannabinoid receptors - CB1(located in central nervous system), and CB2(located in immune cells and peripheral nervous system). To start working, endocannabinoids should bind to a certain receptor and send signal that ECS needs to turn on.\n\nThe work of this system is even more interesting. Endocannabinoids can bind to any receptor, and the effect will be different depending on receptor they bind to and where is it located. For example, if endocannabinoid binds to CB2 receptor in your immune cell, it will probably signal the ECS to relieve inflammation, or if it targets CB1 in your spinal nerve - it will probably signal for pain, and so forth.\n\nUnfortunately, not everything is clear about endocannabinoid system, because it needs much more time to understand all the aspects and parts it affects during work, but we know a bit more about it. There are such things called enzymes.\n\nEnzymes are mostly responsible for breaking down the endocannabinoids, that finished their functioning. To the moment there are two known enzymes - fatty acid amide hydrolase, which is responsible for breaking down AEA(anandamide),and monoacylglycerol acid lipase, which usually breaks 2-AG.\n\nSince we know a lot more about functioning of this system, we should clear the most interesting part - how CBD interacts with this system?\n\n## How CBD and THC interact with your endocannabinoid system?\n\nTo understand how CBD behaves in your body and interacts with your endocannabinoid system, and why is it so good, we should learn first how THC does it.\n\nFirst of all, THC is the primarypsychoactive compound of cannabis plant(it means that it will make you high).When it gets in your body, it binds to endocannabinoid receptors, like your natural endocannabinoids, but THC can bind to both CB1 and CB2. It hijacks the ECS, and tries to replace your natural endocannabinoids 2AG and AEA.\n\nAfter that, you start feeling yourself high. Simply put, molecules of THC mimic your natural endocannabinoids and while being consumed they have power to control your perception of pain, appetite, and other functions in a not healthy way. Mostly, THC overclocks your ECS and regulates everything by itself.\n\nIn contrast, CBD doesn’t have any negative effects and simply cannot get you high, no matter how much you use, because it just works differently. Unlike THC, CBD doesn’t try to replace endocannabinoids, but instead binds to the receptors and helping them to produce much more cannabinoids.\n\nMany believe, that CBD molecules also help endocannabinoids to work more without breaking down, but there are more to study and research before making any firm claims. As for now, it is time to get a bit deeper and learn another interesting moment connected with endocannabinoid system.\n\n## What is endocannabinoid deficiency?\n\nThere is a theory, that is floating on the internet and between some scientists called clinical endocannabinoid deficiency, or CECD. It is suggested, that low levels of endocannabinoids or even ECS dysfunction can lead to development of certain health conditions.\n\nThere is a study<sup>[1](#note_1)</sup>, that reviewed over 10 years of research on the subject, and that explained why some people can develop fibromyalgia, migraines, and irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nUnfortunately, none of these have working treatment, some of them can even develop other conditions alongside, and if CECD plays role in development of these conditions, it means that more research needed to understand the work of endocannabinoid system, and that can lead to discovery of new wave treatments for those diseases.\n\nWe may say, that endocannabinoid deficiency is still a theory, because there are not much clues leading to firm answers, but it is only a matter of time till we see some new material and try to add it to this research.\n\n## Bottom line.\n\nEven if CBD self-treatment looks good for you, it doesn’t mean that you should instantly start using it without proper knowledge. It is recommended consulting with your pharmacist or doctor first, because any CBD product can [interact](https://cbdspace.io/cbd-and-drug-interactions-is-it-dangerous/) with your daily medication and even have some undesirable side effects. None of the material listed here is a truth in first instance. It is made only for your education, and in some cases to help in your searches before talking to doctor. In our guides we try to give all the information possible and hope that it will be useful to you. Remember, the market is still pretty unregulated and all hasty decisions can lead to some troubles. We personally recommend you to be accurate with your help and even if you want to experiment with your body, do it appropriately.
