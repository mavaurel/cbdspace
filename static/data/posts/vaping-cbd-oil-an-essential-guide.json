  "content": "To the moment, CBD became one of the most demanded natural treatments across the world. As for United States, that’s all started since the [2018 farm bill](/2018-farm-bill-and-what-it-means-for-cbd-industry/), that allowed to produce and sell hemp products(but only for licensed growers and if the amount of THC in the plant does not exceed 0.3%), came in. After that, various products, almost instantly flooded the stalls of your favorite markets. The diversity of choice available for consumers is fascinating - everything from CBD infused vape juices, oils, lotions to various beverages and [edibles](/cbd-edibles-an-essential-guide/) of all kinds. \n\nWe may say, that since that moment, the overall trend on CBD only increased its popularity across the world, and there are some serious reasons for that. The first one is incredible therapeutic potential and possibility to treat certain [issues](/what-are-the-uses-of-cbd-will-it-work-for-me/) like depression, anxiety, skin problems, PTSD, heart-related problems, some forms of pain and much more. \n\nTons of researches and lab tests are being made to discover CBD full potential, and it is only a matter of time till we see all the benefits and overall effectiveness. \n\nThe second main reason is the abundance of products available and the fact that they’re pretty easy to access and use. However, the variety of products is also a kind of pain when we come to the point of choosing a certain form for yourself. Fortunately, in series of in-depth guides we are going to share with you everything we know about this or that particular type of CBD. \n\nSo, today we are going to talk about one of the most convenient and quick methods to use your daily CBD - vaping. First things first, it is necessary to acquire basic knowledge of CBD in general, before heading to vaping and all the components involved. So, what is CBD and how does it work?\n\n#### Basics: What is CBD and how it works?\n\nFirst of all, CBD abbreviation stands short for cannabidiol and represents one of the primary compounds found in cannabis plant. As for his nearest cousins, you have probably heard of THC, the primary psychoactive compound of cannabis. Unlike THC, CBD can’t get you to the “high” state no matter how much and how long you use, because it just works differently. CBD is usually being extracted from the hemp plant, which is only legal in the U.S. if the amount of THC in it not higher than 0,3%, so, officially, it cannot get you to the altered state in any ways. \n\nIt can be consumed in various [forms](/how-do-i-take-cbd/). For example, you can consume CBD infused edibles or pills, drop special oils under your tongue, rub infused creams and lotions into your skin, or inhale special CBD infused liquids with your vape pen. Before heading to our main subject, we should determine in the next paragraph, how CBD interacts with your body in general.\n\nEvery one of us has its own endocannabinoid system(ECS), which is a complex of receptors giving signals to our body and produces cannabinoids to maintain homeostasis and our overall wellness. The ECS is responsible for regulation of many functions in our body: immunity, mood, memory, appetite, etc. For example, the thing known as “runner’s high” is a result of working ECS. \n\nEndocannabinoid system has receptors, that either CBD or THC interact with, CB1 and CB2. Unlike THC, CBD due to its shape doesn’t try to replace our natural hormones called anandamide, but just binds to these receptors producing much more cannabinoids to maintain our natural body rhythms. \n\nThe exact ways of how CB1 and CB2 receptors affect on our brains isn’t fully understood so there are still more to study and research. We know, that you are already tempted to read about your first CBD vape oil device. So, what should you know about vaping before buying your first kit?\n\n## How can I start vaping CBD, what does it need?\n\nVaping CBD oil may be the one of the most popular methods featured for consumers all over the world. It is possibly quite beneficial supplement for people with various issues, that provides quick and convenient relief. However, when it comes to choosing devices and products it becomes a discouraging task for newcomers and simply inexperienced vapers. So, what should you know in a first order?\n\nAs you probably know, the vape devices may vary one from another, but they all consist of the almost similar basic components: heating element(known as atomizer), battery, mouthpiece and liquid container. Simply put, the device works by heating material that contains in a special chamber, and the vapor comes out consumes inhales from a mouthpiece. So, all devices share that basic similarities. \n\nHowever, there are still some different styles you can consume your CBD. The two most common vaping device types - pens and tanks. The tank vapes are usually associated with big and foggy clouds in vapers community. These devices are being filled up with special e-liquids, or vape juices, that consist of mixture of glycerin, propylene glycol, various flavorings and CBD itself. The other thing is that tanks heating elements are usually filled with special cotton fuse absorbing liquids in order to get to the coils. \n\nTank devices also have some variations. They can be disposable, or refillable. Disposable vapes usually provide special prefilled CBD cartridges. It is the most convenient and popular type for unexperienced vapers. However, they are usually made of cheaper materials and in most cases the quality of devices is questionable. Disposable vapes also are not really customizable and you have no access to coils, other materials and can’t be sure about quality of your liquid and CBD int it. \n\nAdditionally, without proper knowledge, you can overheat the device and it will be useless. As for refillable type, it is customisable, users choose their own liquids, usually change coils and cotton by themselves, and are pretty more advance in their maintenance. Tanks in general are more complex than pens, and require much more precision and knowledge, as well as investment, to control all the aspects of their device. \n\nFor this type we may conclude, that it is going to be a great choice for people who are common with complicated devices and would like to discover the full potential of vaping CBD hemp oil by themselves. \n\nIn contrast, pen-like vape devices are commonly used to consume concentrated CBD by placing it on the coils. The device consists of chamber with a heating coil on the bottom that heats your CBD directly. However, these coils must be replaced by new periodically when they burn down, and they are not pretty cheap. It is normal for coils to oxidize, so they don’t live for a long period, and in order to extend their lifetime it is better to use only pure CBD products. Before making any decisions on your first vaping device, let’s talk a bit about potential risks of vaping CBD oil. \n\n### Potential risks of vaping CBD.\n\nWhere the benefits come over, here are some potential risks as well. We suppose, that this is quite necessary to know all the risks and potential drawbacks before pursuing any device or product. Some of CBD vape users report to be allergic, or developing an allergy on some materials and chemicals, containing in their liquids. \n\nStudies usually find some metals and other dangerous chemicals in commercial products. There are also reports of some lung damage and even deaths. However, it is commonly associated with poor regulation of products and untrusted vendors. This industry is growing extremely fast, so federal laws and other organizations still can’t regulate all parts of the market. \n\n#### The absence of appropriate regulation.\n\nAs we have mentioned before, there is no one to care for the all vendors and manufacturers of CBD and vaping. FDA(Food and Drug Administration) struggles to research and control both vaping and CBD, so it is allowed for now to sell these products, because the risks and safety of the CBD itself still hasn’t been evaluated properly. \n\nFortunately, none of the injury or death cases were associated to vaping CBD, but laws and specialists recommend to use only trusted products and don’t believe in all brands, because they just want to receive their piece of money on that market craziness.  \n\nWe do also see, that there is no proper information on vaping CBD [safety](/is-cbd-safe-data-and-research/) status due to all this madness that floats around. We strongly recommend consulting with your doctor or pharmacist first, because it would be much better for your health to have a conversation with a specialist before making any decisions. \n\nHowever, we understand that not all the doctors are familiar with CBD, but they can help you with finding right organizations that will know for sure and help you with fulfilling your personal demands. For those of you, who are aware of this, we made a personal chart of things any person should know while purchasing CBD, and we will share it with you in our next paragraph. \n\n#### How can I choose right CBD? \n\nWhen it comes to choosing products, you must always be wise and careful, because the mistakes may cost you health. Here we want to give you some personal advice to your CBD market discovery:\n\n* ***Legality status:*** First of all, check state and federal laws of your area.
