  "title": "CBD vs THC. Is CBD better?",
  "content": "Nowadays, it’s nothing surprising seeing full stalls at your stores flooded with various CBD products, from oils and vape liquids to creams and gummy bears infused with it. Millions of people all over the globe already use CBD on a daily basis due to its natural medical properties. You have probably heard of its nearest cousin - THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, which is responsible for all the psychoactive effects in cannabis plant. Basically, the main difference between these two compounds is that CBD cannot get you to the “high” state no matter how much you gonna use, because it works other way. So, you might have some questions about why THC is still a thing after learning the fact that CBD is quite as beneficial as THC is, but without any serious side effects like getting high? It is not really as simple as it looks. Tons of researchers and scientists still discovering and studying the full potential of CBD and its possible drawbacks. However, both CBD and THC have their own advantages and disadvantages other than their legality status, so it is hard to say from the first sight which one is better and how to make a right choice. So, the aim of today’s talk is to make everything about these two clear, and help you to make a wise choice depending on your personal demands and thoughts. First thing first, let’s begin directly with determining the most common terms.\n\n## Basically, what is CBD?\n\nCBD stands for cannabidiol, the second major chemical compound found in the cannabis plant. As we have mentioned before, CBD cannot get you high because it works differently than THC. Every one of us has an endocannabinoid system, which is responsible for making our own cannabinoids to maintain our overall wellness and regulation of appetite, mood, memory, pain sensitivity and immune system. It’s kind a biological pathway that contacts with our common body functions. CBD molecules interact with receptors in our endocannabinoid system known as CB1 and CB2, but it does not replace our natural neurotransmitters because of its shape, so CBD binds to these receptors instead in order to help produce much more cannabinoids and maintain your natural body rhythms. According to several studies, CBD claimed to be a possible treatment for some conditions, such as anxiety, depression, epilepsy, insomnia, heart-related problems, etc. It is usually being extracted from a hemp plant and fortunately, according to the 2018 farm bill, it is now allowed to grow hemp with the amount of THC up to 0,3% on the territory of the United States, but only if you are a licensed grower. Furthermore, some states still prohibit to grow any cannabis, so be aware, check if it is legal in your area. On top of that, CBD was reported to be totally safe in its pure state, so if you are looking for some natural health support without any psychoactivity, it is probably for you, but you should consult with your doctor or pharmacist first, because it may interact with your daily medication and body in general. The next thing to determine THC and why is it allegedly worse even if they are parts of the same plant?\n\n## What is THC?\n\nBasically, it is a first major compound of cannabis plant. It is much better known than CBD because of its wide history, but today we are going to talk only about its medical properties, not recreational use. THC is responsible for the most of psychoactivity in cannabis and that is the biggest drawback of using it. Unlike CBD, THC doesn’t bind to our receptors but hijacks them. The shape of THC molecules is quite similar to our neurotransmitters in ECS called anandamide, so THC just tries to replace them and that makes us feel the “high” state. Simply put, THC mimics these neurotransmitters in order to regulate our perception of pain, eating habits and other functions by itself in a not healthy way. Due to the high psychoactive properties of THC, it is not safe in general way and mostly illegal in many countries, but for example some state laws of America allow growing and selling marijuana though. However, some THC products are being used in a medicine because of its therapeutic properties, usually to relieve some types of pain, inflammations and other conditions that need strong relaxants and quick relief effects. To that point, you are probably thinking of why THC is still being used if we have a good replacement as his nearest cousin CBD? As we have said before, it is not that simple, because each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. Let’s get a bit deeper and try to make everything clear.\n\n### What are the benefits of CBD over THC?\n\nGenerally, CBD and THC have many in common if we talk about their medical benefits. They provide nearly the same relief from several conditions, though CBD does not cause any psychoactive or euphoric effects that THC does, and this fact may become prevalent in your choice. So, CBD indicates to be helpful with some conditions, researches claim:\n\n* Epilepsy(some time ago the FDA officially approved medication to treat strong forms of epilepsy)<sup id=\"ref_1\">[1](#note_1)</sup>\n* Inflammation<sup id=\"ref_2\">[2](#note_2)</sup>\n* Depression<sup id=\"ref_3\">[3](#note_3)</sup>\n* ADHD<sup id=\"ref_4\">[4](#note_4)</sup>\n* Anxiety<sup id=\"ref_5\">[5](#note_5)</sup>\n* Heart-related problems<sup id=\"ref_6\">[6](#note_6)</sup>\n* Parkinson’s disease<sup id=\"ref_7\">[7](#note_7)</sup>\n* Rheumatoid arthritis<sup id=\"ref_8\">[8](#note_8)</sup>\n* Schizophrenia<sup id=\"ref_9\">[9](#note_9)</sup>\n* Diabetes<sup id=\"ref_10\">[10](#note_10)</sup>\n* Severe forms of pain(neuropathic, chronic, etc.)\n* Acne<sup id=\"ref_11\">[11](#note_11)</sup>\n* Withdrawal and substance abuse<sup id=\"ref_12\">[12](#note_12)</sup>\n\nand much more. The full potential of CBD in therapeutic use is still here to be discovered by scientists and it is quite hopeful to see positive results. While CBD presents to be an optimal treatment for inflammation and various pain conditions, THC appears to help better with cramp-related pains, nausea, glaucoma and muscle spasticity. However, using high doses of THC may cause serious troubles and even aggravate your symptoms more instead of relieving and many of people still don’t prefer to use it due to the difficult side effects management, but let’s tackle the question more in detail before the judgement.\n\n### What’s the entourage effect?\n\nBefore heading to the side effects we should talk a bit about this common term known as an “entourage effect”. It is generally used to describe a synergy between CBD and THC while using full-spectrum products(that contain most of the cannabinoids from the plant including THC and CBD). Simply put, while a product interacts with your endocannabinoid system, CBD molecules frustrate most of the psychoactive effects that THC provide, so that gives you the opportunity to get the full range of therapeutic benefits. However, there is no strict science on that, just some positive reports, so we may suppose that it is an individual thing.\n\n###  CBD and THC side effects.\n\nAs for CBD, it is mostly safe and well tolerated, so the side effects range is not that large, just keep in mind, that the majority of them are linked with a drug to drug interactions between CBD and your daily medication. On the other hand, THC appears to be less friendly and may cause some temporary side effects besides getting high while using. It usually causes an increased heart rate, slows your reaction, makes your mouth dry and eyes red, coordination problems and habitual users reported to have some memory problems. Unfortunately, it is a result of THC psychoactive properties, but we can’t call these side effects critical due to the high therapeutic opportunities that may be helpful with your conditions. It is still hard to say which one is better, but we will try to sort it out in order for you to make a right choice.\n\n### What to choose?\n\nEarlier we broke down most of the common things and terms you should know, but how to make a choice? Which product should be better for me? The whole new CBD industry provides tons of various products available to buy where it is legal. Oils, creams, edibles, vape liquids and much more to explore. For those who are strongly decided to use some THC, but scared of its psychoactive effects, there are some good reasons to try full spectrum products that contain both CBD and THC, that won’t get you as high as isolated ones. Individuals who need high doses of CBD may use isolates, that are extracts without any additional components. We also recommend you to consult with your doctor or pharmacist first, because as we said before, these products can interact with your daily medication and get things worse. Moreover, it is strongly recommended visiting a specialist, because bad manufacturers and sellers on the market just want money from you, and they don’t pay attention to your health and wellness, so be wise while buying something and use only approved and licensed products. Additionally, THC may be prohibited in your area and be actually illegal, so it would be better to check the laws first.\n\n#### Bottom line.\n\nChoosing things that might benefit your health may become a serious problem, if you are not paying much attention to it. Be accurate with your body and health, because it’s really important and do not believe untrusted resources. Make your own decisions, but we hope that these articles will be helpful to you either ways. We are glad to hear your feedback, because it’s our job to create useful and informative content for you.
