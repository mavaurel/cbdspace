  "content": "All of you have probably already discovered the new product, that is one the market everywhere at the moment - CBD, or cannabidiol. Everything from oils and different edibles to creams and vape liquids infused with CBD are already on the shelves of your favorite stores. You have to be a caveman in order to not to notice the increasing popularity of this thing. It is believed by the americans, that the miraculous properties of CBD products can become a remedy to all of our diseases and problems. Although, many of us still have questions about it. Does CBD really work? Let’s check and find out, why is it so popular and could it really become your daily life saviour.\n\n## What is CBD and why is it so crazy popular nowadays?\n\nLet’s start with the basics and define what CBD is. CBD, or cannabidiol is a second major chemical compound found in cannabis sativa plan, also known as marijuana or hemp. Unlike his cousin, THC, or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol which is also an active source of marijuana, CBD isn’t psychoactive at all and that gives it much more therapeutic potential than THC. CBD molecules bind to some receptors in our endocannabinoid system and help producing tons of cannabinoids to keep us relaxed without getting high. Sounds good, right? All the benefits of THC, but totally legal. These fundamental properties gave scientists and researchers an opportunity to explore the full potential of CBD.\\\n\\\nIt is all clear, but who gave an impulse to a CBD flood? The CBD explosion is a result of 2018 farm bill<sup id=\"ref_1\">[1](#note_1)</sup>, that lifted and old prohibition on growing hemp in the United States. Now licensed farmers can grow hemp legally anywhere in the U.S. as long as it contains less than 0,3% of THC in the plant. That’s why Drug Enforcement Agency can’t control hemp products like CBD and they can easily get to the market right now. So, is there any evidence that all these products really work and it’s not only because of a change in federal law. Let’s puzzle it out.  \n\n## Is there any factual confirmation, that CBD does actually work?\n\nIf we talk about the real evidences of CBD treatment, good example is Epidiolex - the FDA(Food and Drug Administration) approved drug to treat two forms of childhood epilepsy. It is truly work and can ease that form of seizures. Another medical uses mostly directed to anxiety, sleep disorders and pain. Therefore, there are evidences that CBD could be helpful in its potential for some medical conditions, but nobody says that it could cure cancer or something. So if you see any marketing directed to cancer treatment, beware of the product.\n\nFrom that point, we could say that CBD actually works, but definitely not as a cure-all drug, only as a support for some medical conditions and there much more to test and study before talking about other diseases. There we are heading into another stirring question - even if it works, is it safe to use even for confirmed kinds of diseases and disorders?\n\n## Is CBD harmful in any ways?\n\nMany of researchers and scientists were truly shocked how fast the CBD boom took off with that little confirmed studies and lab tests. Fortunately, there are not much side effects that could be really harmful for your body. For the adults who want to use CBD in some recreational purposes it is mostly nothing to be afraid of except a probable nausea, irritability and fatigue, but of course you should check twice before buying an untested product  and be aware of its possibility of interaction with your daily medication. For everybody else it is necessary to talk with your doctor first before start using CBD in medical purposes. On the top of that, from time to time researchers exploring various ways in which CBD can behave badly. For example, some time ago they found, that CBD eye drops could increase ocular pressure, and that is only one of many, so take time before using any of CBD products. \n\nAbove all that we talked earlier, there are still a lot of bad manufacturers and marketers who just only want money, and your health is not their concern. It is only a result of bad federal regulation of CBD products and sometimes you just have no opportunity to find out if its good product or bad. Nearly 40% of products on the market contain too little CBD, whereas 20% too much, and even 1\\5 product could accidentally contain much more THC than it is stated on the mark. For most of the people, who want to use CBD daily it is better to wait until the scientists will explore all the CBD’s potential extensively and it’s gonna take some time. For those who are already in tempt to try this new product is our next question - can CBD help for you in particular?\n\n## Can CBD be helpful in my case?\n\nMostly, the biggest amount of lab tests and researches was done on rats, but people’s studies on CBD are much thinner. Therefore we gonna talk about them in order.\n\n### Let’s start with sleep, could CBD really help me to sleep well?\n\nA 2018 study<sup id=\"ref_2\">[2](#note_2)</sup> concluded, that CBD has a good potential in treating Insomnia and REM sleep behaviour disorder. 409 people used and app to record frequency of their symptoms before and after using CBD. For more than 1000 total sessions they have reported, that they experienced a relief from their disease. Even though people were using not isolate CBD products, but with THC, the researchers were highly focused right on the effect of thc. So we may say, that in some cases CBD could be a good thing for those of us who have sleep problems like insomnia.\n\n### The next on the line is one the most frequent problems - pain. Could CBD help me relief my pain?\n\nVarious lab tests shown, that in case of rats CBD was helpful in easing different kinds of pain. Rats were given CBD orally and topically on the regular basis and they have experienced a relief over the time. Most of the researches and tests concluded that CBD could be really handy in case of different types of pain: neuropathic pain, arthritis, inflammations, etc. On the other hand, it is suggested that CBD could also be good for chronic pain, and that’s encouraging. So, if you are in need some pain relief - consult with your doctor and give it a shot.\n\n### Could CBD set me free from my stress and anxiety?\n\nIn test<sup id=\"ref_3\">[3](#note_3)</sup>, where rats were given CBD to relieve stress and panic activity, results were quite well, but the dosing can’t really be compared to people, so it means the research on animals couldn’t get near to the necessary outcome. Fortunately, there was a social testing on real people. Study<sup id=\"ref_4\">[4](#note_4)</sup> says, that 60 people on the test were offered placebo “anti-anxiety” drug Klonazepam, or one dose of CBD before speaking in public. Those people who took medium dose of CBD showed much lower anxiety than placebo or other doses of CBD. It’s kind of a good result, but we suppose, that should be much more similar testing, because one single dose can’t really give a needed effect to confirm that CBD is a good everyday solution. That’s why, there is no firm answer to the question if it is helpful for stress and anxiety or not. \n\n### Should I take CBD in recreational purposes, just to relax?\n\nDue to the fact, that it is possible to relief stress, pains and anxiety using CBD, so it is true that all those things combined should help person to feel relaxed. This research<sup id=\"ref_5\">[5](#note_5)</sup> makes an assumption, that CBD helps to modulate brain activity and mood, when it stimulates endocannabinoid system. Furthermore, some other studies concluded, that there is a possibility for CBD to act as an antidepressant. It was so called “behavioral despair test” on mice, which showed better maintenance when given CBD. So, there’s a good potential for CBD recreational usage and could be even better getting high of THC.\n\n## I tried to use CBD, but I don’t feel anything special, is it working for me?\n\nFirst thing to mention, CBD unlike THC doesn’t have any psychoactive properties. It means that no matter how much you gonna take CBD, it could not get you high anyway. It is not mind altering, so the effects is gonna be much less visible and time dependent. Most of the CBD users report that in some time they started to feel less nervous, their sleep has improved and their pains were lesser in complex. If you don’t feel anything while taking CBD for a while, you should remember, that every person have his or her own body and it could interact differently with each one of them. Maybe you should change your dosage in order to understand your body and how it feels of CBD. Always check your CBD source, because the one thing that fits one’s demands, may not fit other’s. Moreover, you should think of various forms of taking CBD like tinctures, gummies, vapes, etc. Be patient and take your time to experiment during time with all these instructions, the result will not be momentary, so it is up to you to find the optimal condition for your wellness. The last thing is, don’t force yourself if it bothers you in uncomfortable way. \n\n## Conclusion\n\nAccording to a research that we made today, we can totally confirm, that CBD does work, but there is much more to study than it is known at the moment. So be aware of bad marketers, always check twice before buying something and don’t forget to visit doctor before start using CBD.
