  "content": "According to statistics, CBD became one of the most popular natural treatments for now. After the [2018 farm bill](https://cbdspace.io/2018-farm-bill-and-what-it-means-for-cbd-industry/), that allowed producing and selling hemp on the territory of the United States(but only for licensed growers and if the amount of THC in the plant does not exceed 0.3%), CBD products almost instantly flooded the stalls of your favorite stores, and even specific CBD stores were opened. The diversity of products available for consumers is even more interesting - everything from various oils, CBD capsules, vape liquids to waxes and foods of all kinds.\n\nAfter that, the overall trend on CBD has only increased, and there are serious reasons for that. The first one is incredible therapeutic potential and possibility to treat certain issues like depression, anxiety, skin problems, PTSD, heart-related problems, some forms of pain and much more. Tons of researches and lab tests are being made to discover CBD full potential, and it is only a matter of time till we see all the benefits and overall effectiveness.\n\nThe second main reason is the abundance of products available and the fact that they’re pretty easy to access and use. The possibility of CBD to become a serious supplement to your daily medication or even a standalone treatment is kind of promising. However, the variety of products is also a kind of pain when we come to the point of choosing a certain form for yourself.\n\nFortunately, in series of in-depth guides we are going to share with you everything we know about this or that particular type of CBD. As for now, we are going to talk about one particular form of edible CBD - capsules, and how are they going to benefit your health. However, before we get to the capsules, we should figure out some information about CBD in general to understand all the needed terms and aspects. Therefore, what is CBD and how it works?\n\n#### Basics: What is CBD and how does it work?\n\nFirst of all, CBD abbreviation stands short for cannabidiol and represents one of the primary compounds found in cannabis plant. As for his nearest cousins, you have probably heard of THC, the primary psychoactive compound of cannabis. Unlike THC, CBD can’t get you to the “high” state no matter how much and how long you use, because it just works differently. CBD is usually being extracted from the hemp plant, which is only legal in the U.S. if the amount of THC in it not higher than 0,3%, so, officially, it cannot get you to the altered state in any ways.\n\nIt can be consumed in various [forms](https://cbdspace.io/how-do-i-take-cbd/). For example, you may inhale it by vaping CBD infused liquids, or eat infused edibles like gummy bears or CBD capsules, or even take it topically with creams and lotions, but the most popular method across users is taking it sublingually, getting special tinctures under your tongue. It is clear, you may choose any of it depending on your demands and reasons, but how does it work in general?\n\nEvery one of us has its own endocannabinoid system(ECS), which is a complex of receptors giving signals to our body and produces cannabinoids to maintain homeostasis and our overall wellness. The ECS is responsible for regulation of many functions in our body: immunity, mood, memory, appetite, etc. For example, the thing known as “runner’s high” is a result of working ECS.\n\nEndocannabinoid system has receptors, that either CBD or THC interact with, CB1 and CB2. Unlike THC, CBD due to its shape doesn’t try to replace our natural hormones called anandamide, but just binds to these receptors producing much more cannabinoids to maintain our natural body rhythms. The exact ways of how CB1 and CB2 receptors affect on our brains isn’t fully understood so there are still more to study and research.\n\nFurthermore, when it comes to consuming your CBD edibles, there comes a so called “first pass effect”. It means that before having any effect or relief, the product must get through your digestive system, and only after that it gets into your bloodstream. Simply put, the amount of CBD digested may be reduced before getting into your bloodstream.\n\nFortunately, if you are into consuming edible products, it shouldn’t be distressing for you. With a proper knowledge, you will get as much CBD as it needs. So, after getting common with the work and the origin of CBD, we have to make some information about CBD edibles clear. Therefore, what are the CBD edibles?\n\n### What are CBD edibles?\n\nBasically, we may call CBD edibles any food or beverage, like capsules chocolate, water or syrup that it infused with CBD. It is generally being made by adding CBD extract to any of those products. Edibles can be either isolate(using only CBD) or full-spectrum(containing other cannabinoids found in cannabis plant like THC). CBD edibles can be used for either recreational or medical purpose.\n\nMany people report that CBD may be used as a supplement or even a standalone treatment for certain health [issues](https://cbdspace.io/what-are-the-uses-of-cbd-will-it-work-for-me/), however we’re still lacking studies and researchers to verify, that it is a good choice for treating health problems. Fortunately, U.S. laws and health organizations claim that CBD is completely safe in its pure form and is well tolerated by humans.\n\nThe major advantage of this type of CBD is the variety of forms available for consumers. However, every medal has its reverse, and we should collect information not only about methods of using CBD, but about particular forms of them as well. As for now, it is time to see what are the CBD oil capsules and their effects. As for edibles in general, you can find more information here.\n\n## CBD capsules and their potential uses.\n\nSimply put, consuming CBD hemp oil capsules is pretty much the same as your prescription medication. These always come in an easily digestible capsule form, like most of other supplements. You may take them whenever it is wanted, before going to bed, or right after you’ve woken up in the morning.\n\nCapsules designed as an easy to use natural treatment for several health issues like insomnia, depression, heart-related issues, some forms of pain, migraines and much more. We will discuss these issues a bit later, but now let’s get further into understanding capsule form. While other forms of CBD usually get to local ECS receptors, for example topicals activate local ECS receptors under your skin, but things like edibles get straight to your digestive system before getting to work.\n\nCBD capsules are being consumed orally and activating only when digestion process is finished. It means, that there comes the “first pass” effect, that we mentioned before. For many of you it seems like it’s not a very effective method to use you CBD, because some quantity of CBD in your capsule may reduce while getting through your digestive tract, but that’s not the full truth. It may be a problem only at the first sight, because habitual edible users know how much CBD they need to stay fit, and that’s only a little challenge for newcomers.\n\nOn the other side, you experience the full potential of CBD through your whole body while using capsules, because they activate all the ECS receptors in your body. Of course, this way is not for everybody. There are some issues, that need specific forms of CBD, focusing on certain areas of your body. However, today we discuss particular capsule form. So, they may be used for plenty of health issues, but what are they good for particularly? How CBD capsules may benefit my health?\n\n### Benefits of using CBD capsules?\n\nAs we mentioned before, CBD capsules are an easily digestible natural supplement, that can be used daily to treat certain health issues. Unlike any other medication, there are no evidence of overdosing or negative side effects, except some temporary states like diarrhea, dizziness or low blood pressure, but that is reported to be only individual thing.\n\nAs for treating health problems, CBD claimed to be good at boosting your immune system, because government declared that type of cannabinoids a powerful antioxidant. For example, fruits and vegetables are straight antioxidants, but CBD while used daily can prominently improve your immune system, according to several studies and the verdicts of government. Other issue to treat is anxiety.Anxiety is a serious condition that affects millions of people across the globe.\n\nSome studies show, that CBD might be helpful with stimulating your brain receptors for serotonin production, that helps to stabilize your mood. Therefore, taking CBD capsules can help regulate your mood and make you feel less stressed, so to relieve from your anxiety symptoms. Moreover, CBD doesn’t have any psychoactive properties, so there is nothing to hold you from relaxed state and clear state of mind.\n\nAnother advantage of using CBD capsules is skin health improvement. Our body usually produces oils and other things, that may cause acne and other skin issues. CBD may help to hydrate your skin and regulate oil production, as well as boosting your long term skin health. Other than helping your skin, CBD oil may help you with severe forms of pain, starting migraines and ending with seizures.\n\nDue to the high pain and inflammation relieving properties of CBD and a little evidence of negative effects on your body, it may become a good replacement to several opioids, that are being used for pain relief, but that is all in a visible future. The general effectiveness of CBD capsules for pain is usually connected with the property of binding to your ECS receptors, that helps with reducing areas of pain and overall pain discomfort. The last, but not the least possible benefit of CBD is to help fighting with drug addictions. Several studies showed, that CBD can help you limit dependency on some addictive substances.\n\nSo, the potential of CBD is rather promising, however it needs much more research and scientific information before we can actually say it is working properly for these kinds of issues. For those, who are still into trying some CBD, we will make a kind of dosage advice. However, we do strongly recommend visiting your doctor before purchasing anything or deciding to do self-treatment.\n\n#### Dosage advice.\n\nThere are no best options on your way of discovering benefits of CBD, everything is individual and may vary from person to person. Choosing your optimal dosage depends not only on how much you weight or the condition you treat, but also on a certain amount of CBD in any product you take.\n\nFor example, several CBD product like gummies or capsules tell you how much CBD you are going to consume with a single serving. It might be labeled, that there is a 10 mg per capsule or gummy in the bottle so it is gonna be rather easier for you to track how much you consume.\n\nIf you use a so called CBD tincture, it comes in a dropper bottle, and the label may say how much of CBD is in a single drop, but as it usually is, there is a total amount of CBD listed on the label. From that point, what should I do to know how much CBD is consumed? There’s nothing to worry about. Let’s do the simple maths. One drop is about 0.05 milliliters (ml). This means that a 10 ml bottle of CBD oil contains 200 drops. And if the label on that 10 ml bottle says that the bottle contains 1000 mg of CBD, each drop will contain about 5 mg of CBD. So, to have 20 mg of that form of CBD oil, you should take four drops.\n\nThis is a starting information for those, who are lacking knowledge or didn’t get proper guidance from their pharmacists.
