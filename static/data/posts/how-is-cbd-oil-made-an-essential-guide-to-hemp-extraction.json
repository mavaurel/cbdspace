  "content": "Nowadays, CBD became one of the most popular natural supplements among people. Many of you are probably using CBD as a daily supplement, or even a treatment for some conditions. You also know, that CBD is a chemical compound that can be found either in marijuana or hemp plant.\n\nWhat’s interesting, is the fact that marijuana contains much more CBD, than hemp, however, it is typically to see [hemp-derived](https://cbdspace.io/hemp-vs-marijuana-derived-cbd-whats-the-difference/) CBD, and there are some serious reasons for that. First of all, marijuana plant is not only rich for CBD, but for THC as well. It means, that plant becomes highly psychoactive and simply illegal, and its products cannot be sold in most states.\n\nIn contrast, due to the [2018 farm bill](https://cbdspace.io/2018-farm-bill-and-what-it-means-for-cbd-industry/), hemp production became legal on the territory of the United States and that gave a shot to many new products on the market, such as CBD products. On the other hand, regular person cannot grow hemp, because it is rounded with several rules and limitations over the plant, and it is only officially legal to produce and sell hemp products only for licensed growers.\n\nWhile CBD products are so popular nowadays, that fact gives an opportunity for different companies to create various [methods](https://cbdspace.io/how-do-i-take-cbd/) of using CBD, and of course numerous products. Nonetheless, the most popular way to consume your CBD is to drop special tinctures made of CBD oil under your tongue. It is so famous because of its simplicity in use and quite excellent \\[Tooltip]bioavailability\\[Tooltip].\n\nBefore you can use your tincture, there must be an oil, that is mixed into it. How this oil appears? That’s an interesting question and the main topic of our today’s discussion. Before being a tincture, or vape juice, or even a capsule, CBD should be extracted first, because oil is used as a primary ingredient in most of CBD products.\n\nThe extraction process is a kind of complicated thing, that can affect quality, purity and contents of a resulting product. Today we are going to cover the variety of hemp extraction methods, and of course answer some connected questions.\n\nFirst things first, let’s talk about where CBD starts its way, or simply about the hemp plant, because without this beneficial and useful plant, there couldn’t be any CBD product. So, what is hemp plant, and why is it so important for society?\n\n## What is hemp and what role it plays in case of CBD production?\n\nCurrently, hemp has finally been given a definition separate from marijuana, due to the farm bill. After that, hemp and its derived products became completely legal as any other agricultural crop. Furthermore, hemp, which is defined as a cannabis containing less than 0.3% THC in it, is excluded from controlled substances act and can be sold and produced within following rules by licensed growers.\n\nWhat’s more interesting, is that legality status and widespread production sort of helped it to become the primary source of CBD. It’s also can be produced out of marijuana, but this plant is not only reach with CBD, but with THC as well. It means, that in most cases these products are commonly illegal in most states, but if it is legal in your area, you can find CBD products, that are marijuana derived through appropriate channels.\n\nAll this information means, that many growers across the United States are extracting CBD from hemp at the moment and are trying to find how to create the purest and highest quality product. In order to know, how to find the best extracts on the market as possible, we should learn first what forms of hemp extraction exist. So, what does hemp do before becoming CBD oil?\n\n## How many methods of hemp extraction exist?\n\nAs it is already clear, hemp must undergo an extraction process in order to become crude extract. We may call it the first step on its way to become one of CBD products available on the market.\n\nThe general concept of any hemp extraction method is to make solvent pass through plant material in order to separate needed active compounds from the plant materials.\n\nThe resulting oil substance contains cannabinoids, terpenes, chlorophyll and more, so it means, that this is not the final oil, that is ready to be certain product, but the substance, that should be further processed to become a product.\n\nSo, in order to create different products we should use different extraction methods, and here they are:\n\n***CO2Extraction.***\n\nThis extraction is widely known as an excellent method to produce CBD-rich extracts. The concept of this method is to put carbon dioxide under high pressure while maintaining a low temperature. So, the gas is transformed into a liquid due to the high pressure to pass through the plant material with nearly 90% efficiency. The resulting substance is highly concentrated and pure.\n\nHowever, this extraction method is quite expensive and requires extensive equipment to work with. So, when it becomes a final CBD product, it is usually higher priced than others, because of the extraction method used, but you can be verified, that the quality of a product purchased will be on the highest level possible.\n\n***Ethanol Extraction.***\n\nIn contrast to previous method, ethanol extraction is much lower-cost method, but is often used by various companies. In order to create the highest quality products with this method, it’s going to require much more expertise and post-extraction processing.\n\nThis extraction method uses an alcohol solvent - ethanol. Ethanol is a polar solvent, which means it will mix with water and dissolve water-soluble molecules in addition to extraction of primary compounds. This method helps to extract chlorophyll alongside with other compounds. The problem is, that if we want to get rid of chlorophyll, we should do some extra steps, where we can lose some amount of our cannabinoids.\n\nWe may say, if we want to produce the highest quality extract with this method, the operator and extractor should be as experienced as possible, because via using ethanol extraction being not experienced enough, there will be errors and possibility of resulting lower quality product.\n\n***Hydrocarbon Extraction.***\n\nThis was an early option to extract from hemp. Hydrocarbons like butane, pentane, propane, hexane, isopropyl alcohol or acetone were used as a solvent for hemp extraction. Simply put, people used it, because these hydrocarbons have low boiling point, which makes them ideal for CBD hemp oil extraction.\n\nThe point is, that this method is very cheap and quite easy. However, it isn’t ideal at all. It is a common for this method to see resulting substances without proper amounts of terpenes, or CBD, and high amounts of THC instead.\n\nFurthermore, some solvent remains can be found in a resulting substance, so the can affect your immune system in time. That’s why it is rarely used nowadays and considered as a pretty dangerous method to produce CBD product. Thus, be aware.\n\n***Lipid Extraction.***\n\nThis one is rarely used and is called lipid extraction. This method uses the “lipids” or simply fats to absorb and encapsulate hemp compounds. This extraction method often uses coconut organic oil, and it doesn’t require any dangerous solvents or even CO2. It is not used commonly, nonetheless you may find products done by using this extraction method.\n\n## Additional steps, or purification and processing.\n\nIt is clear, that resulting \\[Tooltip]crude extract\\[Tooltip] is not nearly a final product, and there are some optional extra steps, that should be performed in order for product to be ready for consumption.\n\n***Winterization.***\n\nFirst extraction usually brings unwanted materials with the needed, so there is a process called winterization, which is performed to further purify the first extract and get rid of unwanted components. This process is essential for most extraction methods, except low temperature ethanol extraction.\n\nThe process of winterizing consists of mixing up our extract with alcohol and freezing it overnight to get the cloudy mixture which is going to be filtered. The filtration is done by running the substance through the paper filter into an extraction bar.\n\nThe remaining alcohol is removed from the final product by warming it, because the boiling point of alcohol is much lower than oil.\n\n***Compound Activation.***\n\nAs you probably know, cannabinoids that we extract come firstly in acid form, and in order to produce needed molecules, they should be activated first. For example, \\[Tooltip]CBDA\\[Tooltip] should be activated in order to produce CBD.\n\nSo, to activate these acids, all the extract should undergo the process called decarboxylation. Simply put, heat the extract. While being heaten up, the acid molecule is removed and the active compound is produced.\n\n***Isolation or Removal.***\n\nEven after all other extraction processes and filtering, the final product is still [full range](https://cbdspace.io/what-is-full-spectrum-cbd-what-is-it-good-for/), which means that extract still has full profile of cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, etc. What if we want to get rid of something, or even isolate CBD from any other cannabinoids?\n\nIf we want to remove group or a single cannabinoid from the extract, we should use processes like distillation or chromatography. Talking of CBD, you can commonly see [CBD isolates](https://cbdspace.io/what-are-cbd-isolates-what-are-they-good-for/). This is the good example of isolating single CBD, without any additional cannabinoids, or terpenes. In purest form, isolates are a crystalline white powder containing 99% of pure CBD. Chemists often use short path distillation or chromatography to isolate individual compound like CBD.\n\n## Bottom line.\n\nThis material is created only in educational purpose, so we don’t force you doing anything like instantly start using CBD or something like that. This only presented to you as a beginners guide, or something you should be interested in about CBD. We hope that our research would be useful and glad to see your feedback.
