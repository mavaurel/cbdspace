  "content": "Nowadays, CBD is available in a wide range of products: creams, oils, tinctures, vape liquids and edibles of all kinds. Due to its explosive popularity, it is being actively researched at the moment as a promising assistant of your overall health and wellness. CBD is a non-intoxicating compound found in cannabis plant. It means that it cannot make you “high” unlike his nearest cousin - THC(tetrahydrocannabinol), which is a primary psychoactive compound of cannabis plant. Despite the fact that is pretty popular right now, it is regulated quite badly. Food and Drug administration just only approved a drug called Epidiolex, which is created to treat some forms of epilepsy. For now CBD is rather different due to many methods of use, so you should be aware of what to expect and learn what to use and how to do it properly. This article is a brief guide for all of you who want to start using CBD for any purpose.\n\n## So, what are most popular forms of CBD?\n\nBasically, there are four primary methods of how you can use CBD: sublingual(under your tongue), topical(on the skin), orally(by eating) and inhale(by vaping or smoking). All these methods are equally getting in your body and interact with endocannabinoid system(receptors in your organism that help to maintain homeostasis and overall wellness). Nevertheless, each one has its own difference between like effect duration and how long does it take to start working. Every method has its strengths and weaknesses, so let’s talk about them in order. \n\n## Methods of using CBD\n\n### Sublingual\n\nGenerally speaking, it is the most common way to use CBD. Both oils and tinctures are taken via a dropper under your tongue. It holds there around a minute so that CBD could easily get in your bloodstream through the little capillaries. It lasts for about 2-4 hours, is quite easy to use and control your dosage. This method’s absorption speed and long-lasting activity makes it pretty effective and that’s why it is so popular among other forms of usage. Mostly, all these tinctures are made of CBD and oils like coconut or hemp seed oil. They may also contain other ingredients such as some additional flavors, vinegar, ethanol, etc. If you look for a quick and easy results - this one is totally your way to use CBD. \n\n### Edibles\n\nThere are various types of food and drinks infused with CBD that can be easily purchased and used on a daily basis. Moreover, capsules and pills can be added to your meals and also be effective. It is a straightforward and discreet way to use CBD, because edibles are being digested in your stomach to get to the bloodstream. Scientists talk about “first pass effect”<sup id=\"ref_1\">[1](#note_1)</sup>, it means that part of digested CBD is being broken before taking an action, that’s why this method isn’t as popular as sublingual. Additionally, it takes much more time to take an effect, around 30 minutes for empty stomach, and couple of hours if you ate recently. On top of that, there’s key advantages of this form - the effect lasts from four to six hours and you may take an exact dose of CBD so that makes it easier to control your daily CBD consumption. Basically, if you are into ingestion way to use CBD, the effect is gonna be significantly longer and beneficial, of course.\n\n### Inhalation\n\nThis method allows you to absorb CBD through your lungs by breathing. It’s rather efficient way to use CBD and by the way, smoking has always been main method to use cannabis. Nowadays, CBD mostly taken safeway, by vaping liquids from a special device. The main advantage is that the CBD’s effect can be felt almost immediately by vaping, so it is fantastic for people who are in need of immediate relief, because the absorption rate of this method is quite similar or sometimes even bigger than the sublingual type. People state that it is the most enjoyable and convenient way to use CBD, because you can use different flavors and take it pretty much everywhere you want, due to vapes handy properties. Unfortunately, it’s effects last for a short period, something around an hour, so it is a main weakness of this method. Furthermore, vaping requires much more knowledge to get handled with a device as well as it needs additional investment, but there also are some devices like vape pens that are much easier to deal with. So, it’s up to you, but if you find this way closer, it is not that hard to get by. \n\n### Topical\n\nIt is believed, that CBD-infused creams and lotions are able to relieve muscle, arthritis pain and direct inflammation. The last major method of using CBD is applying it directly to skin via cream, lotion or an oil. These products interact with endocannabinoid receptors under your skin instead of bloodstream and that makes it rather beneficial for targeted pain issues like arthritis or inflammation. There is a study<sup id=\"ref_2\">[2](#note_2)</sup> done on rats, showed that CBD gel applied to skin excellently reduced joint swelling that became really promising for people with targeted pains in specific areas. Topical CBD products usually take up to an hour to make an effect and last for around 5-6 hours. Unlike the  sublingual tissue, our skin isn’t that good to absorb CBD and it is key weakness of topical CBD. It is considered, that CBD is also useful for skin-related problems like acne. Moreover, its therapeutic potential could be bigger when these creams and oils are mixed up with analgesics, for example. So, if you are quite close to some massages and things like that, it is gonna be beneficial to your usual daily activities. \n\n## How to choose a good product? What to look at?\n\nFirst of all, you should be aware that all the CBD products may be full-spectrum or isolated. Full-spectrum products contain all cannabis plant sources including both CBD and THC. Meanwhile, isolated products mostly consist of just CBD, and there’s a big difference in choosing what will fit you. Researches<sup id=\"ref_3\">[3](#note_3)</sup> say that you might have better effect when you use  Full-spectrum products with both CBD and THC as if they were taken alone. The next thing to look at when you buy CBD products - is lab testing, because currently they are not regulated by FDA properly. So you must be guaranteed that the product is tested and not going to affect you in any ways. This allows you to be sure of what you buy and put into your body. On top of that, you should buy products that were made from U.S. organic cannabis, because hemp and cannabis growing is being strictly regulated on a federal level, so it is unlikely to consume chemicals and pesticides. \n\n## Consult with your pharmacist\\doctor\n\nThere is no the only one right or best way to use CBD, so it is necessary to find out what will fit you the right way and work properly. Moreover, if you use any medication on a daily basis, you should talk with your doctor first, because CBD and these kinds of products may interact with your medication.\n\n## Bottom line\n\nWe hope that this quick guide would help you to choose the right product for yourself and be aware of any affect it can cause on you. Be accurate with your body and organism and everything will be alright. Stay tuned for more useful guides and articles.\n\n",
