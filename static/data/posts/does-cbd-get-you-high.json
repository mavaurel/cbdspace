  "content": "CBD became a mainstream nowadays, so many of you are already familiar with this term. It instantly flooded the stalls of your favorite stores and obtained its fame in hearts of consumers. The diversity of CBD infused products is unbelievable, everything from oils, creams, vape liquids, edibles and \\[Tooltip]tinctures\\[Tooltip] are available to buy on the market. \n\nThe high popularity of CBD is possibly connected with [2018 farm bill](https://cbdspace.io/2018-farm-bill-and-what-it-means-for-cbd-industry/), that allowed producing and selling the hemp plant on the territory of the United States, but only by licensed growers and the amount of THC in the plant must not be higher than 0.3%. Additionally, CBD is also being that mainstream due to the high therapeutic potential of a compound. Tons of scientists and researchers are continuously discovering more and more useful properties in order to help with several human and animal conditions. \n\nHowever, many of you are still not quite recognized with this product and have several questions. The most frequent out of them is “does CBD oil get you high?” and some adjacent. Before making any conclusions, let’s take a closer look at some CBD common terms and define is it really possible for CBD to make you high in any ways?\n\n## What is CBD and how does it work?\n\nCBD is usually described as one of major compounds may be found in cannabis plant. The CBD abbreviation stands short for cannabidiol. To the moment it is hopeful for CBD to become one of the most popular natural treatments for anxiety, depression, insomnia, some kinds of pain, epilepsy, heart-related issues and much more. \n\nIt can be used in a various [forms](https://cbdspace.io/how-do-i-take-cbd/), for example: CBD infused vape liquids can be inhaled via special devices, or you may use some tinctures, that are usually being dropped under your tongue to get an almost instant relief, or even some infused creams that can be applied to your skin during massage, etc. \n\nScientists claim that CBD is totally safe in its pure form and cannot cause any damage to you. Though the diversity of CBD products on the market is large, not all of you know how does CBD really interacts with your body, and that’s the point of our next paragraph.\n\nEvery one of us has an endocannabinoid system(ECS), which is a complex of receptors giving signals to our body and produces cannabinoids to maintain \\[Tooltip]homeostasis\\[Tooltip] and our overall wellness. The ECS is responsible for regulation of many functions in our body: immunity, mood, memory, appetite, etc. For example, the thing known as “runner’s high” is a result of working ECS. \n\nEndocannabinoid system has receptors, that either CBD or THC interact with, CB1 and CB2. Unlike THC, CBD due to its shape doesn’t try to replace our natural \\[Tooltip]neurotransmitters\\[Tooltip] called anandamide, but just binds to these receptors producing much more cannabinoids to maintain our natural body rhythms. The exact ways of how CB1 and CB2 receptors affect on our brains isn’t fully understood so there are still more to study and research. \n\nAs we have mentioned before, CBD is indicated to be a good supplement or a standalone treatment, but is as beneficial as it is being advertised. Let’s check and figure out how CBD may benefit your health!\n\n## Uses and effects of CBD.\n\nCBD is being a subject of many researches and discussion since it is legal on the territory of the United States. There is a kind of summing up research<sup id=\"ref_1\">[1](#note_1)</sup> showing what we already know about CBD and how it may benefit your health. Simply put, here are some conditions that CBD may be used to treat or become a supplement:\n\n* [Pain and Inflammation](https://cbdspace.io/does-cbd-help-with-pain/);\n* [Anxiety and Depression](https://cbdspace.io/does-cbd-work-for-anxiety/);\n* Heart and circulatory system;\n* Acne Reduce;\n* Drug addiction and withdrawal;\n* Cancer-related problems;\n* Insomnia.\n\nWhat’s more, it is promising to be helpful with schizophrenia to avoid some side effects of antipsychotic treatments. It is only a matter of time before we discover its full potential. To the moment it is clear, that CBD is relatively [safe](https://cbdspace.io/is-cbd-safe-data-and-research/), but it may cause some temporary side effects like nausea, diarrhea, dry mouth or even dizziness. \n\nFurthermore, CBD may interact with your daily medication, so be aware and visit your pharmacist before buying anything. Now it is time to get to our main subject of discussion - will CBD get you high and why do people think that it may get you to that state.\n\n## Why is it believed, that CBD can get you high?\n\nLet’s start with a thing known as THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, which is a primary compound in cannabis plant. It is known among people for its stretching through the centuries story and for being responsible for most of the psychoactivity in the plant. We may call CBD and THC the nearest cousins of the \\[Tooltip]cannabis\\[Tooltip], and that’s the key to answering our question. \n\nMany people assume that CBD effects similarly to THC, but that’s not true. To understand how THC really interacts with our body we should compare it to the work of CBD. Unlike CBD, THC tries to hijack our endocannabinoid system and replace our natural neurotransmitter called anandamide with its own molecules in order to get us to the high state. While THC due to its shape may mimic our neurotransmitters, CBD just binds to the receptors and helps us to stay well. \n\nOther argument is, that CBD and THC may be found in a similar plan, but it is not something to scare of. CBD may be easily(in industrial way of course) extracted and isolated from other compounds like THC and be totally safe at the end. Even more, usually CBD is being derived not from cannabis, but a hemp plant, that doesn’t contain any THC. Even CBD derived from cannabis plant, by the federal law, may contain only up to 0,3% of THC. Guess it’s time to stop beating about the bush and answer our primary question for today - can CBD get you high in any ways?\n\n## All in all, can CBD make you high?\n\nThe final verdict is - no, it cannot make you high no matter how much and how long you use CBD, it just works other than THC and hasn’t got any psychoactive properties. Once being extracted from the plant it doesn’t contain any THC if the plant was grown properly following all the federal and agricultural laws by a licensed grower. \n\nIt is more likely to experience some side effects of CBD from a continuous usage, but to get high is clearly impossible. However, there is still a possibility to get high, but not because of CBD itself, but from a products you may buy. \n\nBecause the discovery of CBD potential is still in progress, it is still complicated to regulate all the products on the market, and that’s where you should be wise while choosing your CBD in order not to be tricked by marketers. Mislabeling, unapproved products and much more, but how to not to get into trouble because of it accidentally? That’s the point of our next paragraph.\n\n## How to be wise while choosing your CBD?\n\nIf you want to consume only pure, [safe and legal products](https://cbdspace.io/how-to-choose-safe-and-approved-cbd-product/), you should observe the product directly before buying. When it comes to buying some CBD, there is a huge variety of forms and products itself, it’s a hard job to do when you are not as familiar with it as we are. \n\nFirst to say, before buying anything, it is better to visit your doctor before, because specialists know better what should be good or bad for your body and certain conditions. Moreover, it becomes more important because we know that CBD may interact with your daily medication. \n\nThere’s still a possibility, that your doctor can’t get you concrete instructions, because CBD is a quite new thing on the market, there’s a way to make a good choice. We gonna share with you some tips that should be helpful while searching for some CBD brands, here they are:\n\n* ***Certification:*** Any CBD product should be approved by a document known as COA, it shows that lab tested and checked for the \\[Tooltip]potency\\[Tooltip]. Moreover, the batch number of COA should match the one on the label. All this information on the product should be easily found according to the local and state laws, it should make your choice more verified on a certain product.\n* ***Testing:*** Any tests on a CBD products must meet with\"ISO 17025\"standards and also be validated with one of the official regulatory organizations:U.S. Pharmacopeia, Association of Official Agricultural Chemists, or the American Herbal Pharmacopoeia.\n* ***Where the hemp comes from?:*** You should always check, that the hemp was produced by a licensed grower on the territory of the United States and fits all the agriculture laws, that will totally help you find the right product that might fulfill all your demands.\n\nIf you are going to follow these simple tips, the job of choosing CBD will be a cakewalk.\n\n## Bottom line.\n\nEven though we know that CBD couldn’t go bad in any ways, you should be careful with your body and health, because it is up to you to keep it safe. Don’t be inaccurate to stuff even if you know it’s gonna be alright after all. This whole article is not a command to go and use CBD daily.
