  "content": "Nowadays, CBD is being on its peak of popularity. It is presented in a wide range of products: oils, creams, lotions, vape liquids and edibles of all kinds. Due to its explosive popularity, it is being actively researched as a potential supplement or even a standalone treatment for certain issues. \n\nThat’s all started from the [2018 farm bill](https://cbdspace.io/2018-farm-bill-and-what-it-means-for-cbd-industry/), that allowed to produce and sell hemp plant on the territory of the United States, but only if you are a licensed grower and the amount of THC in your plant does not exceed 0.3%. After that, CBD products flooded the stalls of your favorite markets and even CBD stores came in selling diversity of products. \n\nHowever, when it comes to choose a certain form or a CBD brand, you will probably face some serious questions that are going to need firm answers. So, basically, the subject of today’s discussion is how to choose safe and approved CBD product without any accidents. First things first, let’s determine all the commons connected with CBD!\n\n## What does CBD mean and how it works?\n\nGenerally speaking, CBD is one of the major compounds found in cannabis plant, and the CBD abbreviation stands short for cannabidiol. Unlike his nearest cousin THC, which is the primary compound of \\[Tooltip]cannabis\\[Tooltip], and is responsible for most of the psychoactivity of the plant. \n\nSimply put, CBD cannot get you to the “high” state no matter how much you use, it is just impossible, because it works differently. Furthermore, CBD is usually extracted from the hemp plant, and the amount of THC in it is quite small, so there is no way you can get accidentally high from it. So, if CBD is quite similar to THC, why it works other way? That’s a good question! Let’s get to the point of how does CBD work.\n\nEvery one of us has its own endocannabinoid system(ECS), which is a complex of receptors giving signals to our body and produces cannabinoids to maintain \\[Tooltips]homeostasis\\[Tooltip] and our overall wellness. The ECS is responsible for regulation of many functions in our body: immunity, mood, memory, appetite, etc. For example, the thing known as “runner’s high” is a result of working ECS. \n\nEndocannabinoid system has receptors, that either CBD or THC interact with, CB1 and CB2. Unlike THC, CBD due to its shape doesn’t try to replace our natural \\[Tooltip]neurotransmitters\\[Tooltip] called anandamide, but just binds to these receptors producing much more cannabinoids to maintain our natural body rhythms. The exact ways of how CB1 and CB2 receptors affect on our brains isn’t fully understood so there are still more to study and research. Before heading to shopping for CBD, we should understand fully the benefits and uses of CBD in general.\n\n### Uses, benefits and side effects of CBD.\n\nTo the moment, there are plenty researches claiming high therapeutic potential of CBD. It is claimed, that it might become a good supplement or even a standalone treatment to some conditions, such as insomnia, depression, anxiety, acne, severe kinds of pain, heart-related issues, and more. There are also some experiments claiming that CBD should be useful in helping with drug addictions and \\[Tooltip]withdrawal\\[Tooltip]. \n\nHowever, not all the benefits are presented with strict evidence, but CBD in general gives positive results, and it is only a matter of time before we will see more studies. Scientists claim that CBD is completely safe in its pure state so it is not likely to cause any damage. However, there are still some temporary side effects you should be aware of: fatigue, nausea, diarrhea and several mood and weight changes. \n\nThese sides are not so crucial and it is more individual, than common problem. What’s more important, that CBD may [interact](https://cbdspace.io/cbd-and-drug-interactions-is-it-dangerous/) with your daily medication and you should be pretty careful in case of your own health and wellness. Now let’s talk a bit about forms of CBD and how you can use it in general. There are four primary methods:\n\n### Sublingual.\n\nIt is the most popular form of CBD at the moment. Generally speaking, it is the most common [way](https://cbdspace.io/what-is-sublingual-cbd-an-essential-guide/) to use CBD. Both oils and tinctures are taken via a dropper under your tongue. It holds there around a minute so that CBD could easily get in your bloodstream through the little capillaries. It lasts for about 2-4 hours, is quite easy to use and control your dosage. \n\nThis method’s absorption speed and long-lasting activity makes it pretty effective and that’s why it is so popular among other forms of usage. Mostly, all these tinctures are made of CBD and oils like coconut or hemp seed oil. They may also contain other ingredients such as some additional flavors, vinegar, ethanol, etc. If you look for a quick and easy results - this one is totally your way to use CBD.\n\n### Edibles.\n\nThere are various types of food and drinks infused with CBD that can be easily purchased and used on a daily basis(for example, gummies infused with CBD, or a water). Moreover, capsules and pills can be added to your meals and also be effective. \n\nIt is a straightforward and discreet [way](https://cbdspace.io/cbd-edibles-an-essential-guide/) to use CBD, because edibles are being digested in your stomach to get to the bloodstream. Scientists talk about “first pass effect”<sup id=\"ref_1\">[1](#note_1)</sup>, it means that part of digested CBD is being broken before taking an action, that’s why this method isn’t as popular as sublingual.\n\n### Inhalation\n\nThis form allows you to absorb CBD through your lungs by breathing. It’s rather efficient [way](https://cbdspace.io/vaping-cbd-oil-an-essential-guide/) to use CBD and by the way, smoking has always been main method to use cannabis. Nowadays, CBD mostly taken safeway, by vaping liquids from a special device known as \\[Tooltip]vape pen\\[Tooltip]. \n\nThe main advantage is that the CBD’s effect can be felt almost immediately by vaping, so it is fantastic for people who are in need of immediate relief, because the absorption rate of this method is quite similar or sometimes even bigger than the sublingual type. People state that it is the most enjoyable and convenient way to use CBD, because you can use different flavors and take it pretty much everywhere you want, due to vapes handy properties. Unfortunately, it’s effects last for a short period, something around an hour, so it is a main weakness of this method. \n\n### Topical.\n\nIt is believed, that CBD-infused creams and lotions are able to relieve muscle, arthritis pain and direct inflammation. The last major [method](https://cbdspace.io/what-are-cbd-topicals-an-essential-guide/) of using CBD is applying it directly to skin via cream, lotion or an oil. These products interact with endocannabinoid receptors under your skin instead of bloodstream and that makes it rather beneficial for targeted pain issues like arthritis or inflammation.\n\nSo, there are a lot of ways to consume your CBD, but before buying anything, you should know how to choose whatever CBD and why should you be wise while shopping for it.\n\n### Why should you be wise while shopping for CBD?\n\nIt is not a secret that CBD is quite popular thing and the variety of products available for consumers on the market is marvellous, but here come some issues.
