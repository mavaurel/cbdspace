  "content": "According to statistics, CBD became one of the most popular natural treatments for now. After the [2018 farm bill](/2018-farm-bill-and-what-it-means-for-cbd-industry/), that allowed producing and selling hemp on the territory of the United States(but only for licensed growers and if the amount of THC in the plant does not exceed 0.3%), CBD products almost instantly flooded the stalls of your favorite stores, and even specific CBD stores were opened. The diversity of products available for consumers is even more interesting - everything from creams, lotions, vape liquids, to different edibles and special sublingual tinctures.\n\nAfter that, the overall trend on CBD has only increased, and there are serious reasons for that. The first one is incredible therapeutic potential and possibility to treat certain issues like depression, [anxiety](/does-cbd-work-for-anxiety/), skin problems, PTSD, heart-related problems, some forms of pain and much more.\n\nTons of researches and lab tests are being made to discover CBD full potential, and it is only a matter of time till we see all the benefits and overall effectiveness. The second main reason is the abundance of products available and the fact that they’re pretty easy to access and use.The possibility of CBD to become a serious supplement to your daily medication or even a standalone treatment is kind of promising. However, the variety of products is also a kind of pain when we come to the point of choosing a certain form for yourself.\n\nFortunately, in series of in-depth guides we are going to share with you everything we know about this or that particular type of CBD. As for today, we are going to talk about the most popular way of using CBD oil - sublingual(under the tongue), but before we should determine all the basics connected with CBD in order to fully understand the topic. So, what is CBD and how does it work?\n\n## Basics: What is CBD and how it works?\n\nFirst of all, CBD abbreviation stands short for cannabidiol and represents one of the primary compounds found in cannabis plant. As for his nearest cousins, you have probably heard of THC, the primary psychoactive compound of cannabis. Unlike THC, CBD can’t get you to the “high” state no matter how much and how long you use, because it just works differently. CBD is usually being extracted from the hemp plant, which is only legal in the U.S. if the amount of THC in it not higher than 0,3%, so, officially, it cannot get you to the altered state in any ways.\n\nIt can be consumed in various [forms](/how-do-i-take-cbd/). For example, you may inhale it by vaping CBD infused liquids, or eat infused edibles like gummy bears or pills, or even take it topically with creams and lotions, but the most popular method across users is taking it sublingually, getting special tinctures under your tongue. It is clear, you may choose any of it depending on your demands and reasons, but how does it work in general?\n\nEvery one of us has its own endocannabinoid system(ECS), which is a complex of receptors giving signals to our body and produces cannabinoids to maintain \\[Tooltip]homeostasis\\[Tooltip] and our overall wellness. The ECS is responsible for regulation of many functions in our body: immunity, mood, memory, appetite, etc. For example, the thing known as “runner’s high” is a result of working ECS.\n\nEndocannabinoid system has receptors, that either CBD or THC interact with, CB1 and CB2. Unlike THC, CBD due to its shape doesn’t try to replace our natural \\[Tooltip]neurotransmitters\\[Tooltip] called anandamide, but just binds to these receptors producing much more cannabinoids to maintain our natural body rhythms. The exact ways of how CB1 and CB2 receptors affect on our brains isn’t fully understood so there are still more to study and research.\n\nAfter getting common with the work and origin of CBD, we can finally head to our main subject - sublingual CBD. Then, what is the sublingual method and how to use your CBD tincture?\n\n## What exactly sublingual method is, and why is it so popular nowadays?\n\nThere are quite many ways on how you can use your CBD oil, but the most popular is sublingual method. Simply put, instead of swallowing CBD oil, you apply few drops of special tincture under your tongue in order to get to the local ECS receptors there.\n\nMany people find this method the most convenient and a straightforward way to consume CBD. Usually, you hold the oil tincture under your tongue for at least 2-3 minutes to be sure it will be absorbed through your tissues into the bloodstream, and swallow the liquid left. Some other users have some extra steps, but this is not necessary.\n\nBasically, sublingual method gives you the opportunity to get as much CBD into the bloodstream as possible. While there are no special device or equipment needed except for the bottle and a dropper, you can use it almost everywhere indoors and outdoors.\n\nThere are no vapor, smoke or other resulting materials, so it makes your daily CBD usage simple and accessible. Sportsmen and common workers prefer sublingual method due to its simplicity and quick relief. Even if we know that this method is good, what are the benefits after all?\n\n## What are the benefits of using CBD oil sublingually?\n\nThe first and the primary advantage of sublingual method is excellent bioavailability. It means that you will probably get a relief in a short period, but why it works that fast? That’s all happens, because sublingual products don’t get digested and goes directly to your bloodstream avoiding \\[Tooltip]first pass effect\\[Tooltip], so the concentration of product does not reduce while entering your system, unlike consuming edibles.\n\nFor example, when you consume CBD edibles, the products get to a digestive tract first, and the digestion process should be finished before you feel the effect, and of course, most of the CBD extract lefts inactive and doesn’t get to your system. The fact, that sublingual products provide a very fast relief, it makes this method a piece of cake for people with chronic pains, arthritis and other neuropathic pains. Other pain management CBD tips can be found [here](/does-cbd-help-with-pain/).\n\nThe second main benefit of this method is simplicity. There are no special preparation before consuming, no smoke, no outbursts of dangerous chemicals, the bottle is quite small and may fit your pockets or purses without following attention, it may be used almost in any situation or area, and it takes only 10 seconds to open, drop the liquid with a dropper under your tongue, and wait for the relief.\n\nWe may say that this method is also great for people, who don’t like when other people draw attention to what they do, or don’t want to carry devices and other things. Of course, when we talk about strengths, here come some weaknesses as well. For example, how can I know, that I used a proper amount of CBD, it is so hard to tell because of a dropper? Can I even overdose if I use a lot?\n\n## Is it possible to overdose with CBD oil?\n\nAs we can judge, there are no possibilities of overdosing with CBD, because fortunately, it is well \\[Tooltip]tolerated\\[Tooltip] by humans, even with a high doses up to 1500 mg. It is more likely to experience few temporary side effects than get overdosed, because it is not psychoactive and cannot cause any damage in its pure state.\n\nEven if we know that side effects of using CBD tinctures or any other products are temporary and not crucial, you should be aware that without an appropriate attitude you might experience drowsiness, dry mouth issues, reduced blood pressure and lightheadedness.\n\nFurthermore, CBD products may [interact](/cbd-and-drug-interactions-is-it-dangerous/) with your daily medication, so we personally recommend visiting your pharmacist first before making any decisions and trying CBD. Nonetheless, you should be aware of the fact, that CBD isn’t regulated greatly at the moment, so the FDA(Food and Drug Administration) recommends you to buy and consume only licensed brands, that met with some certification process and \\[Tooltip]third-party lab testing\\[Tooltip] in order to be sure in your products safety and even legality.\n\nThat’s all may become pretty dangerous if you are gonna buy fake or low quality product, or the one with inaccurate labeling, so check everything twice before you spend the money.\n\nFor those of you, who are totally ready to try some CBD and already talked to their doctors, but did not get proper dosage advice, we are going to share with you some thoughts on how to calculate your daily dosage, but you should always remember, that everything listed is going to be our opinion, based on several studies and web resources. Other that these tips you can find wholesome dosage guide [here](/cbd-and-drug-interactions-is-it-dangerous/).\n\n## Dosage advice.\n\nThere are no best options on your way of discovering benefits of CBD, everything is individual and may vary from person to person. Choosing your optimal dosage depends not only on how much you weight or the condition you treat, but also on a certain amount of CBD in any product you take.\n\nFor example, several CBD product like gummies or pills tell you how much CBD you are going to consume with a single serving. It might be labeled, that there is a 10 mg per capsule or gummy in the bottle so it is gonna be rather easier for you to track how much you consume. If you use a so called CBD tincture, it comes in a dropper bottle, and the label may say how much of CBD is in a single drop, but as it usually is, there is a total amount of CBD listed on the label. From that point, what should I do to know how much CBD is consumed?\n\nThere’s nothing to worry about. Let’s do the simple maths. One drop is about 0.05 milliliters (ml). This means that a 10 ml bottle of CBD oil contains 200 drops. And if the label on that 10 ml bottle says that the bottle contains 1000 mg of CBD, each drop will contain about 5 mg of CBD. So, to have 20 mg of that form of CBD oil, you should take four drops.\n\nThis is a starting information for those, who are lacking knowledge or didn’t get proper guidance from their pharmacists. Even though, we do not personally recommend trying self treatment and sharing this information only in educational purposes. Always pay attention to what are you doing and be accurate with your health.\n\n## Bottom line.\n\nAs we mentioned before, CBD isn’t still regulated well, and there might be some troubles if you will buy untrusted products without appropriate certification or lab testing. This industry grows day by day, but as in any business, there exist some people, who don’t pay attention to laws and just want to make money on your health. Your wellness must be your first concern and you should make any decisions, only with enough knowledge. We always recommend to trust specialists, because there are tons of incorrect information floating on the internet, and inaccurate advice may cost you health. We hope, that this guide, or our other articles will be useful to you and your searches. Stay tuned for more articles, and don’t forget to share if you liked.",
