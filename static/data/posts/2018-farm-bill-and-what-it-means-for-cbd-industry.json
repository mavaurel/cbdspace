  "content": "Nowadays, CBD is just another part of our ordinary life. Most of us don’t even pay much attention to abundance of products available on the stalls of the markets or special CBD stores. Millions of people across the world are actively using CBD on a daily basis, but that wasn’t so just couple years ago.\n\n\nIt’s all started when the 2018 farm bill came in, and CBD products almost instantly flooded the stalls of the stores across the United States. Everything from oils, tinctures, various creams and ointments, to different vape liquids and edibles of all kinds. CBD became one of the most popular natural supplements, and there are quite concrete reasons for it.\n\n\nFirst of all, CBD is a chemical compound, that is found in cannabis plant, and the abbreviation stands short for cannabidiol. Unlike its cousin, THC, which is the primary psychoactive compound in the plant, CBD does not provide any psychoactive properties. Simply put, it cannot get you to the “high” state no matter how much you use, because it just works differently.\n\n\nInstead of hijacking our endocannabinoid system(ECS), that produces our own cannabinoids, and trying to replace naturalneurotransmitters(special chemical messenger that transmits signals to our brainsto get high, CBD binds to receptors that take place in ECS, to help produce more cannabinoids and keep you well. So, the first reason CBD is popular for is its therapeutic potential. It is claimed, that CBD is helpful with treating certain kinds of issues like pain and inflammation, [anxiety](https://cbdspace.io/does-cbd-work-for-anxiety/), PTSD, depression, acne, cancer-related symptoms, and much more.\n\n\nTons of researchers and scientists are trying to discover the full potential of CBD at the moment and results are pretty promising. It can become a strong supplement for some kinds of health issues or even a standalone treatment for some of them.\n\n\nThe secondary reason is high bioavailability(ability to dissolve and take an effect in human body as fast as possible) and simplicity in use, it means that in most cases you don’t need to prepare much before consuming and CBD itself is well tolerated by humans and absorbed by ECS. However, it needs more time for government and third party researches to make everything clear about CBD.\n\n\nNonetheless, our discussion for today is related more to origins and the background of this wellness trend. As we mentioned before, it is the 2018 farm bill that started all the overwhelming craziness around CBD, and we are going to explain why. So, what is 2018 farm bill and why it is connected with CBD?\n\n## 2018 Farm Bill, and what does it mean for hemp industry?\n\nMost changes of that years farm bill were connected to the industrial hemp. Some of you may be not familiar with the terms, cannabis, marijuana and hemp themselves, so it is our job to help you differentiate these. First of all, hemp and marijuana are just two plants in classification of cannabis sativa family.\n\n\nMarijuana is simply the one plant, that contains more than 0.3% THC in it, and hemp in turn contains less than 0.3%, and is not psychoactive at all, due to the low amount of THC in it. Marijuana is mostly illegal on the federal level as a schedule substance, that is being controlled by special organizations.\n\n\nAs for industrial hemp, its way started not so long before. The 2014 farm bill started a kind of pilot program, that allowed licensed growers produce hemp, but with a lot of rules and restrictions around. The amount they could produce monthly was also controlled, as well as the other aspects, but that all changed in 2018.\n\n\nThe U.S. farm bill that year officially excluded industrial hemp and its products from the schedule 1(means that substance has no current medical use, and has abusive potential)drug chart and federally allowed licensed growers to produce, sell, and transport hemp products across the United States without restrictions, of course, only if it was cultivated in line with the state and federal laws, and the amount of THC in a product doesn’t exceed 0.3%.\n\n\nNow industrial hemp is officially classified as any other commercial crop (agricultural crop that is grown to sell). That was a first reason of CBD entering the overall wellness market so quickly these couple of years. The general regulation of CBD products form that moment was enforced by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States(FDA), and this organization presented CBD as a safe substance, and hemp-derived products are completely legal for sale, but does it mean, that all CBD products are legal on the territory of the United States? Let’s figure it out!\n\n### So, are all CBD products completely legal now?\n\nWell, yes, but actually no. The key to understand the legality of CBD products is hiding in our previous paragraph. Speaking seriously, CBD may be either marijuana or hemp derived, and the legality status depends on the mother plant. Simply put, if your CBD is made of legal industrial hemp, and the amount of THC in it does not exceed 0.3%, you may breathe easier.\n\n\nOtherwise, if your CBD was marijuana derived, the amount of THC in it is much higher than 0.3% and it is still federally illegal(depending on your state laws too, of course). It means that not every label you see with the CBD on it is 100% safe and legal, be aware. \n\n\nWhat’s more, to the moment, CBD isn’t studied enough for FDA to say their final verdict on CBD, and they can’t still regulate the market as much as they should, so the CBD companies are quite open-handed and free to do and sell what they want until the time to pay comes. However, the FDA already approved CBD-based prescription drug to treat some forms of epilepsy - Epidiolex.\n\n\nWe can say, that it is only a matter of time till we see proper attitude from those organizations, but for now it is our job to inform you, how important it is to search for strict science and researches, because with this amount of fake information and untrusted products floating on the internet it is hard to understand whether CBD is a good decision for you.\n\n### Why the research on hemp and CBD is still important?\n\nWhile many people make thoughtless purchases and buying untested products, our job is to warn you how risky it is to make decisions without proper research. The reason, why all the production of hemp before the farm bill of 2018 was overly controlled and had lots of restrictions, was in purpose of protection.\n\n\nOtherwise, government wanted to protect and control the production alongside with researches of hemp and its properties. Even when hemp became a commercial crop, it is still important to generate researches, especially at times, where CBD is a popular natural supplement. However, even now we have much evidence to verify effectiveness of CBD. Some of them are quite anecdotal, but some have pretty promising results, and it is a big step in case of discovering potential of CBD.\n\n\nGovernment realizes that hemp and its derived products have market and overall potential, but it is still important to extend studies, because even if growers and scientists know a lot about this plant, its full potential isn’t still known enough to make final conclusions. Moreover, while federal organizations are working on plants themselves, the market grows day by day, and lots of new products, [ways](https://cbdspace.io/how-do-i-take-cbd/) of using hemp derived production creates.\n\n\nIt is clear, that market is not regulated enough, but imagine, how could you control so many things at the same time, even on a federal level. As we all are existing in pretty the same situation with CBD, if you are into trying it, it is important to check everything before purchasing any product.\n\n\nFurthermore, we highly recommend visiting your doctor or pharmacist, because specialists know better what is good for you, and what is not. However, not all the doctors are familiar with CBD oil and the products available on the market for sale, so it is better to have a little research on the products before visiting your doctor again. In that case, we created a list of some useful tips, that can lighten up your searchings.\n\n### How can I find 100% safe and working CBD on the market?\n\nWhen it comes to choosing products, you must always be wise and careful, because the mistakes may cost you health.
