  "content": "According to statistics, CBD became one of the most popular natural treatments for now. After the [2018 farm bill](https://cbdspace.io/2018-farm-bill-and-what-it-means-for-cbd-industry/), that allowed producing and selling hemp on the territory of the United States(but only for licensed growers and if the amount of THC in the plant does not exceed 0.3%), CBD products almost instantly flooded the stalls of your favorite stores, and even specific CBD stores were opened.\n\nThe diversity of products available for consumers is even more interesting - everything from various oils, pills, vape liquids to waxes and foods of all kinds. After that, the overall trend on CBD has only increased, and there are serious reasons for that.\n\nThe first one is incredible therapeutic potential and possibility to treat certain issues like depression, anxiety, skin problems, PTSD, heart-related problems, some forms of pain and much more. Tons of researches and lab tests are being made to discover CBD full potential, and it is only a matter of time till we see all the benefits and overall effectiveness.\n\nThe second main reason is the abundance of products available and the fact that they’re pretty easy to access and use. The possibility of CBD to become a serious supplement to your daily medication or even a standalone treatment is kind of promising. However, the variety of products is also a kind of pain when we come to the point of choosing a certain form for yourself.\n\nFortunately, in series of in-depth guides we are going to share with you everything we know about this or that particular type of CBD. As for now, we are going to talk about one of the most popular ways to consume your CBD - edibles. In this guide we will try to give all information needed to make a right choice, but before we get to edible, let’s determine all the commons connected with CBD first.\n\n#### Basics: What is CBD and how does it work?\n\nFirst of all, CBD abbreviation stands short for cannabidiol and represents one of the primary compounds found in cannabis plant. As for his nearest cousins, you have probably heard of THC, the primary psychoactive compound of cannabis. Unlike THC, CBD can’t get you to the “high” state no matter how much and how long you use, because it just works differently. CBD is usually being extracted from the hemp plant, which is only legal in the U.S. if the amount of THC in it not higher than 0,3%, so, officially, it cannot get you to the altered state in any ways.\n\nIt can be consumed in various [forms](https://cbdspace.io/how-do-i-take-cbd/). For example, you may inhale it by vaping CBD infused liquids, or eat infused edibles like gummy bears or CBD capsules, or even take it topically with creams and lotions, but the most popular method across users is taking it sublingually, getting special tinctures under your tongue. It is clear, you may choose any of it depending on your demands and reasons, but how does it work in general?\n\nEvery one of us has its own endocannabinoid system(ECS), which is a complex of receptors giving signals to our body and produces cannabinoids to maintain homeostasis and our overall wellness. The ECS is responsible for regulation of many functions in our body: immunity, mood, memory, appetite, etc. For example, the thing known as “runner’s high” is a result of working ECS.\n\nEndocannabinoid system has receptors, that either CBD or THC interact with, CB1 and CB2. Unlike THC, CBD due to its shape doesn’t try to replace our natural hormones called anandamide, but just binds to these receptors producing much more cannabinoids to maintain our natural body rhythms. The exact ways of how CB1 and CB2 receptors affect on our brains isn’t fully understood so there are still more to study and research.\n\nFurthermore, when it comes to consuming your CBD edibles, there comes a so called “first pass effect”. It means that before having any effect or relief, the product must get through your digestive system, and only after that it gets into your bloodstream. Simply put, the amount of CBD digested may be reduced before getting into your bloodstream.\n\nFortunately, if you are into consuming edible products, it shouldn’t be distressing for you. With a proper knowledge, you will get as much CBD as it needs. So, after getting common with the work and the origin of CBD, we can finally head to our main subject - CBD edibles and it effects. Then, what are the CBD edibles and how should I use my foods and beverages infused with CBD?\n\n## What are the CBD edibles, and how are they used?\n\nBasically, we may call CBD edibles any food or beverage, like pills, chocolate, water or syrup that it infused with CBD. It is generally being made by adding CBD extract to any of those products. Edibles can be either isolate(using only CBD) or full-spectrum(containing other cannabinoids found in cannabis plant like THC). CBD edibles can be used for either recreational or medical purpose.\n\nMany people report that CBD may be used as a supplement or even a standalone treatment for certain health [issues](https://cbdspace.io/what-are-the-uses-of-cbd-will-it-work-for-me/) like insomnia, depression, inflammation, severe forms of pain, anxiety, epilepsy, and much more. The studies on CBD and its effects are still going on, so it is only a matter of time till we see a full chart of health problems that it can be helpful with.\n\nSo, don’t be sad if you haven’t seen your issue on the list, you may still try CBD for yourself. The major advantage of this type of CBD is the variety of forms available for consumers. Laws and health organizations mostly claim, that CBD is safe and well tolerated by humans. Okay, we get it, so, what are the forms of CBD edibles available on the market and how should I choose? Let’s figure it out!\n\n### What types of CBD edibles exist and what are the most popular?\n\nCBD edibles may be consumed in various forms, including pills, capsules, baked foods, candies, gummy bears, syrups, chocolates, beverages, cooking oils, and more. Let’s see the most popular ones in order:\n\n* ***CBD gummies:*** Using CBD in form of the gummies may be the best option on the market to enjoy your CBD edibles. Tons of different flavors, as well as choice of other sweets like candies. You may also find some other sweet products that contain some natural ingredients other than CBD like turmeric or spirulina.\n* ***Beverage drops:*** It is usually a liquid or powder product, that are designed to be added to your everyday beverages, water, smoothies, etc. They are generally packed into a standard bottle with a dropper, in order to be easily added to your drinks and experience the benefits of CBD. There are also exist ready to use beverages infused with CBD, so we categorized them into one group. You may use either drops or a ready drink depending on your personal demands and lifestyle.\n* ***CBD pills and capsules:*** Consuming CBD capsules and pills is pretty much the same as your prescription medication. If you are familiar with other pills and don’t really into trying other forms, this one is definitely for you. No flavors, devices, preparations, just eat the pill and wait for the effect of CBD to come in.\n* ***CBD chocolate bars:*** Bars are for those of you who are pretty into chocolate. If you are a habitual sweet tooth, why not to try all these various chocolate bars, with coconut milk, hazelnut, raspberry, and also experience all the benefits that CBD can get for you? From our point of view, it is quite tasty way to enjoy your CBD.\n* ***CBD cooking oils:*** These oils are not for sublingual use, but instead you can add them to various dishes, baked foods, and much more. Cooking with CBD oil is a quite interesting experience, because you can enjoy not only one single gummy or candy, but bake and cook whatever you like the most among these dishes and take your CBD experience on quite other level.\n* ***CBD coffee:*** This one is pretty new and increasing its popularity. We assume that many of your are big fans of morning coffee before getting to work, so now lots of cafes adding to their menu brand new CBD coffee, that is made by adding pure CBD to coffee beans. If you have one in your area and ready to enjoy the benefits of CBD while sipping your morning cup of coffee, that’s a great opportunity.\n\nWhile there are much more variations of CBD edibles, we tried to sum up the most popular among people in order for you to familiarize with the edibles. You may choose whatever form you want depending on your goals and personal taste, of course. The next thing to observe are the advantages of using edible CBD products and how can they help you with your issues?\n\n### The astonishing advantages of using edible CBD products.\n\nFirstly, this way of using CBD is super discreet. There are no special devices, preparations, or needs of carrying big bottles. Just take out your purse, eat your pill or gummy and just wait for the effect. The second major advantage that the effect from CBD edibles is super long-lasting.\n\nHowever, the time for effect to come in is rather long, and we don’t recommend it for people, that are in need of quick relief. This way is more for people, that are interested in having the effect of CBD in their body as much as possible to stay relaxed and concentrated. Even the person writing this uses edibles to stay relaxed and get the best contact with all of you. While you use your edibles, your body needs time till the digestion ends and effect comes in, so be aware and try this one if you want some long and safe relief.\n\nThe next potential strength is that edible for is one of the safest, because scientists have already approved some CBD infused drugs to treat specific issues, and according to studies the side effects of taking CBD orally aren’t dangerous at all comparing to some other pills. The last, but not the least advantage is accessibility. It means, that you can find any edible product you need in seconds.\n\nYou can purchase these products either online or in special stores in your area, but be aware of untrusted vendors and possibility of buying fake or even dangerous products, because the regulation on CBD still isn’t quite well. However, edible products are usually safer to buy comparing to other forms of CBD.\n\nWhen it comes to trying CBD, there are somefrequent questions about dosing and how can you start consuming your daily CBD in general? For those of you who are interested, we are going to make some advice, but strongly recommend consulting with your pharmacist before making any decisions.\n\n#### Dosage advice.\n\nThere are no best options on your way of discovering benefits of CBD, everything is individual and may vary from person to person. Choosing your optimal dosage depends not only on how much you weight or the condition you treat, but also on a certain amount of CBD in any product you take.\n\nFor example, several CBD product like gummies or pills tell you how much CBD you are going to consume with a single serving. It might be labeled, that there is a 10 mg per capsule or gummy in the bottle so it is gonna be rather easier for you to track how much you consume.\n\nIf you use a so called CBD tincture, it comes in a dropper bottle, and the label may say how much of CBD is in a single drop, but as it usually is, there is a total amount of CBD listed on the label. From that point, what should I do to know how much CBD is consumed?\n\nThere’s nothing to worry about. Let’s do the simple maths. One drop is about 0.05 milliliters (ml). This means that a 10 ml bottle of CBD oil contains 200 drops. And if the label on that 10 ml bottle says that the bottle contains 1000 mg of CBD, each drop will contain about 5 mg of CBD. So, to have 20 mg of that form of CBD oil, you should take four drops.\n\nThis is a starting information for those, who are lacking knowledge or didn’t get proper guidance from their pharmacists.

Even though, we do not personally recommend trying self treatment and sharing this information only in educational purposes. Always pay attention to what are you doing and be accurate with your health.\n\n#### Bottom line.\n\nThe CBD industry grows day by day, and it means that you should be always paying attention to new studies or products, because the discovery and regulation of CBD isn’t still on an appropriate level. That is why we make these guides and articles for you. The information listed here isn’t a call of start using CBD instantly.
