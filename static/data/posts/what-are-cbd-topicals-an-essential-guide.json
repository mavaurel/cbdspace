  "content": "According to statistics, CBD became one of the most popular natural treatments for now. After the [2018 farm bill](/2018-farm-bill-and-what-it-means-for-cbd-industry/), that allowed producing and selling hemp on the territory of the United States(but only for licensed growers and if the amount of THC in the plant does not exceed 0.3%), CBD products almost instantly flooded the stalls of your favorite stores, and even specific CBD stores were opened. The diversity of products available for consumers is even more interesting - everything from oils, creams, waxes, lotions, balms, to vape liquids and edibles of all kinds. \n\nAfter that, the overall trend on CBD has only increased, and there are serious reasons for that. The first one is incredible therapeutic potential and possibility to treat certain issues like depression, [anxiety](/does-cbd-work-for-anxiety/), skin problems, PTSD, heart-related problems, some forms of pain and much more. Tons of researches and lab tests are being made to discover CBD full potential, and it is only a matter of time till we see all the benefits and overall effectiveness. \n\nThe second main reason is the abundance of products available and the fact that they’re pretty easy to access and use. The possibility of CBD to become a serious supplement to your daily medication or even a standalone treatment is kind of promising.\n\nHowever, the variety of products is also a kind of pain when we come to the point of choosing a certain form for yourself. Fortunately, in series of in-depth guides we are going to share with you everything we know about this or that particular type of CBD. So, let’s start with defining all the commons connected with CBD, and the first thing to understand is CBD in general. \n\n### What is CBD?\n\nFirst of all, CBD abbreviation stands short for cannabidiol and represents one of the primary compounds found in \\[Tooltip]cannabis plant\\[Tooltip]. As for his nearest cousins, you have probably heard of THC, the primary psychoactive compound of cannabis. Unlike THC, CBD can’t get you to the “high” state no matter how much and how long you use, because it just works differently. \n\nCBD is usually being extracted from the hemp plant, which is only legal in the U.S. if the amount of THC in it not higher than 0,3%, so, officially, it cannot get you to the altered state in any ways. \n\nIt can be consumed in various [forms](/how-do-i-take-cbd/). For example, you may inhale it by vaping CBD infused liquids, or eat infused edibles like gummy bears or pills, drop special liquid called tincture under your tongue, but today we are going to talk about topical CBD. To figure out what this is and how does it work, let’s get to the next paragraph!\n\n## What are CBD topicals and how these things work?\n\nSimply put, we call topical any hemp-infused CBD product that is constructed for applying to skin. First things first, we should determine how CBD interacts with our body in general. Every one of us has its own endocannabinoid system(ECS), which is a complex of receptors giving signals to our body and produces cannabinoids to maintain \\[Tooltip]homeostasis\\[Tooltip] and our overall wellness. The ECS is responsible for regulation of many functions in our body: immunity, mood, memory, appetite, etc. For example, the thing known as “runner’s high” is a result of working ECS. \n\nEndocannabinoid system has receptors, that either CBD or THC interact with, CB1 and CB2. Unlike THC, CBD due to its shape doesn’t try to replace our natural \\[Tooltip]neurotransmitters\\[Tooltip] called anandamide, but just binds to these receptors producing much more cannabinoids to maintain our natural body rhythms. Basically, these receptors are found in many parts of our body - brain, connective tissues, immune cells, glands, organs, and of course - skin. \n\nSo, various forms of CBD interact with our body differently. For example, while using edibles or a \\[Tooltip]sublingual\\[Tooltip] form, cannabinoids are being absorbed in your bloodstream via a standard digestive process. It is a wholesome form, because it interacts with a body itself and the effect of CBD usually last for 4-7 hours. Meanwhile topical products, for example infused CBD cream, when used, penetrating your skin on a molecular level to interact with local endocannabinoid receptors. \n\nThis fact is the most important, because unlike other forms of CBD, topical is quite direct and can be used on specific areas of your body to achieve quick CBD delivery. This is an ideal choice for certain skin problems and maintaining healthy skin functioning, but we will talk about it a bit later through our guide. As for now, we are going to share with you some information about types of existing topical products. \n\n## What forms of topical products exist?\n\nAs we have mentioned before, there are many ways to use your topical CBD. So, we should differentiate every product in groups divided by criteria. We are going to share with you the most popular ways, but these groups may contain tons of other variations. Here they are:\n\n***CBD salves, ointments and balms.***\n\nThe first category and the most popular way is using different salves, balms, or ointments. We included these into one category, because in case of common ingredients they are usually pretty much the same. Any product in this group contains an oil base to deliver your CBD to receptors of ECS in the skin, a natural wax to be easily applied, of course hemp extract, and countless varieties of optional ingredients like flavorings. \n\nThe main difference between these is their consistency according to a concentration of wax in them. While balms are usually thicker and fatty, because they consist more wax, salves and ointments are more watery, but it doesn’t mean that last one worse or better, it’s just a matter of taste. The oils in them are genuinely made for better delivery to ECS and all the products in this group are constructed to stay longer on the skin and provide the active ingredients of CBD.\n\n***Transdermal patches infused with CBD.***\n\nThese things called \\[Tooltip]transdermal\\[Tooltip] patches, are CBD infused stickers that are created to stick for a long period without any spots on clothes and for people with active lives. We differentiated patches into one particular group, because it works a bit other way than a usual topical product. These patches are applied to skin, but deliver cannabinoids to your bloodstream, not only local skin receptors, and acts on \\[Tooltip]system level\\[Tooltip], where we can relate it to ingested products, but it still provides localized support and lasts for a long period - from 10 to 12 hours.  \n\nThis also may become a great choice for people with needs of wholesome CBD effect, but do not prefer other forms or even don’t like taste of hemp, for example. Basically, transdermal patches are a good, regulated and long-lasting support for your wellness. \n\n***CBD creams and lotions.***\n\nCreams and lotions infused with CBD are something similar to salves and balms, but with some other qualities, that’s why they have their particular group. CBD creams contain a mix of oil and water, to deliver not only CBD to your ECS, but as well as moisturizing effect to your skin. \n\nThis is a great teamwork for your skin health, but it has some drawbacks too. While balms are being created to stay longer on your skin and provide benefits of CBD, creams and lotions may last shorter, because of \\[Tooltip]potency\\[Tooltip]. This one is the perfect choice for those who are suffering from sore skin and at the same time want a localized support of cannabidiol. \n\n***CBD bath bombs.*** \n\nThe last, but not the list is the group of CBD infused bath bombs. It is usually a normal bath bomb, but with addition of hemp extract. While the idea of dispersing CBD in the water and absorb it with your whole skin, the result is not quite promising. We know that CBD is hydrophobic, this way can’t be as effective as it sounds like. \n\nWe assume, that the contact with your skin, as well ass with your ECS is minimal, and we cannot guess, how much of active ingredients are staying on your skin while using this kind of product. It is also being argued as even \\[Tooltip]placebo-like\\[Tooltip] thing, because for now there is no clue, how beneficial it is. However, if you are a big fan of bath bombs, there is nothing bad in trying something new with CBD ones, even if its effectiveness is kind of questionable, at least. \n\n## What are CBD topicals good for at last?\n\nThe numbers of researches and studies claiming evidence of topical CBD effectiveness in case of some issues. According to all the information, we may assume, that topical form of CBD is going to be a great choice for people, who are focusing on issues problems with specific body areas rather than an overall relief. Here are some potential issues, that you can relieve with topical CBD creams, ointments, balms, etc: \n\n* Arthritis pain\n* Headaches or even migraines\n* Foot and hand pain\n* Joints\n* Muscle pain\n* Psoriasis\n* Eczema\n* Menstrual cramps\n\nHowever, there’s much more to study before judging and making a final verdict. We know that many of you still struggling whether using this form for yourselves. “Should I use topical CBD for my arthritis or headache?”\n\n## Is this form a right choice for me?\n\nNobody will answer this question but yourself. This new whole CBD industry grows and most advertisers and manufacturers would say yes without any analysis, but you should know that sometimes they just want to make money on you and they don’t care about your health as much as you should. \n\nOur personal advice is - don’t make any decisions without proper research or talking to a specialist first. It is as easy as it sounds - consult with your pharmacist if you have any troubles with research. Furthermore, even if CBD is [safe](/is-cbd-safe-data-and-research/) after all, it can [interact](/cbd-and-drug-interactions-is-it-dangerous/) with your daily medication, which can cause serious trouble. We know, that not all the doctors are familiar with CBD products, but the can give you advice on where can you buy approved and safe products for sure. \n\nAs for topical products, we gave you all the common information you should know about it, and if you decide to try - give it a shot, but be wise. Experiment with different products and track your results in order to find the best combination and effectiveness for you specifically. Don’t be shy and ask questions from specialists and certain CBD brands. \n\n## Bottom line.\n\nIn our articles we try to represent actual information we found from legit resources, but we don’t recommend you believe everything you see. This is our personal impression based on some studies and researches which is made for your common education on a certain topic. Additionally, we are not forcing you to make any decisions, but just providing some information that we find handy for your searches.
