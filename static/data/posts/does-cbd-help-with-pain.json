  "content": "Millions of people around the world already use CBD on a daily basis and it is quickly elevated as a mainstream across a society. Tons of products, such as various oils, vape liquids, creams, and edibles of all kinds flooded the stalls of the U.S. markets. If you did not even hear of CBD, you are probably living in a cave. Its high therapeutic properties and simplicity opened the doors in human hearts. A large amount of researchers and scientists are trying to discover the full potential of CBD at the moment, but we already have some strong evidence of its effectiveness in helping with treating certain conditions. However, we are being frequently asked about how CBD may benefit this or that particular condition. The subject of today’s discussion is one of the most common conditions - pain in its several forms. Even if it is a common issue, it may become a serious problem without a proper treatment. There comes the brand new product known as CBD, but is it as good as it is being advertised? Can it help with relieving my pain? Let’s answer these questions together starting with determining all the commons connected with CBD in order to be credible.\n\n## What is CBD and how does it work for pain?\n\nFirst of all, CBD is one of the major compounds may be found in cannabis plant and stands short for cannabidiol. Unlike his nearest cousin THC, which is known for its long history and psychoactive properties, CBD cannot get you to the high state no matter how much you gonna use, just because it works differently. The fame of CBD quickly escalated due to the 2018 farm bill, that approved producing and selling hemp plant on the territory of the United States, but only if you are a licensed grower and the amount of THC in your plant not higher than 0.3%. There are a lot of ways to consume CBD, for example: you may use edibles infused with CBD, like gummy bears or pills, that are being mixed with your daily meals, or inhale infused liquids via your vape device, or even use it topically by rubbing special creams and lotions into your skin, but the most popular method is sublingual, by dropping special oil under your tongue to get almost instant relief. The origin is clear, but how does it work?\n\nThat’s a good question! Every one of us has its own endocannabinoid system(ECS), which is a complex of receptors giving signals to our body and produces cannabinoids to maintain homeostasis and our overall wellness. The ECS is responsible for regulation of many functions in our body: immunity, mood, memory, appetite, etc. For example, the thing known as “runner’s high” is a result of working ECS. Endocannabinoid system has receptors, that either CBD or THC interact with, CB1 and CB2. Unlike THC, CBD due to its shape doesn’t try to replace our natural hormones called anandamide, but just binds to these receptors producing much more cannabinoids to maintain our natural body rhythms. The exact ways of how CB1 and CB2 receptors affect on our brains isn’t fully understood so there are still more to study and research. However, it is already known how CBD interacts with your ECS to relieve your pain. Some studies have shown that CBD might be even better for pain relief comparing to usual treatment like ibuprofen. It works better because its anti-inflammatory mechanism is unique to others. CBD molecules inhibit glutamate release and other inflammatory agents, which makes it excellent in helping with severe forms of pain. Let’s get straight to the point and define how CBD oil can help to ease different kinds of pain!\n\n### Is CBD good for a chronic pain?\n\nDue to the work of your endocannabinoid system, CBD may help to stimulate your ECS and normalize your response on some pains. This response creates anti-inflammatory and pain relieving effect. Simply put, according to these facts, CBD may be quite beneficial for people with chronic pains. To be more concrete, there is a study<sup id=\"ref_1\">[1](#note_1)</sup> that shows how well might CBD work to relieve chronic pain. Additionally, this research examined not only chronic pain, but neuropathic pain as well. Basically, we may conclude, that CBD is effective in overall pain management and doesn’t cause any side effects in time. We may also notice, that it is not likely for CBD to build up tolerance so you won’t be need to increase your dose if you choose it as your daily pain-relief treatment.\n\n### What about migraines?\n\nUnfortunately, the studies on CBD for migraines particularly are quite limited, and all of them used full spectrum products(CBD and THC both) as their subject. However, according to this study<sup id=\"ref_2\">[2](#note_2)</sup>, CBD and THC claimed to be beneficial for people with migraine pains. Briefly, it was a 2 phase experiment, where participants were given different amounts of CBD and THC. When the dosage increased to 200 mg, the overall periodicity of migraine attacks fall by 40-50 percent. Another conclusion of this research was that CBD might be effective for migraines, but only if a person’s migraine attacks began in their childhood. There’s much more to discover, but there’s no strict clues that CBD may be a standalone treatment for now in case of migraines.\n\n### Can CBD help me with arthritis pain?\n\nThere is a study on rats<sup id=\"ref_3\">[3](#note_3)</sup>, that looked on a potential of CBD helping with arthritis pain. During the experiment, rats were being applied with CBD infused gel for 4 days in a row. They were distributed into 3 groups by the amount of CBD received: 0.6,3.1,6.2. and 62 mg per day. While there were no obvious side effects, the results were quite positive. Those who were given low doses(0.6 and 3.1) did not quite improve their pain management. Meanwhile, those who received high doses succeed in reducing their pain and swelling. However, there was no serious difference between 6.2 and 62 mg groups and scientists concluded that dose of 6.2 mg CBD was highly enough to reduce overall pain levels in rats, because larger dose wasn’t seriously more beneficial in reducing pain. Overall verdict is that CBD hemp oil is potentially good for people with arthritis pain. However, it’s only a matter of time till we have more studies to be verified.\n\n#### Is there any possibility, that CBD can help me to relieve cancer pains and chemotherapy side effects?\n\nIt is not a secret, that people with cancer might also use CBD. First of all, there is a research<sup id=\"ref_4\">[4](#note_4)</sup> on rats which results were kind of extraordinary and have shown that CBD usage can lead to shrinking cancerous tumors. Unfortunately, the results were quite outstanding just in case of rats, but there were some other lab tests and experiments showing the role of CBD in relieving cancer-related pains. The main reason CBD should be used in case of cancer is chemotherapy and its side effects. The major of them are vomiting, pain and overall lack of appetite, and that was the point where National Cancer Institute saw CBD as a helpful supplement for these particular issues. Most of other researches available looked at CBD and THC in conjunction with opioids to avoid cancer-related pain, so there are no strict information on how magically CBD works in case of cancer, so don’t get cheated and be aware of actual information.\n\n### How to use your CBD for pain?\n\nAs we’ve mentioned before, there are a lot of ways to consume your CBD, but with this diversity it is hard to choose, isn’t it? Firstly, you need to determine the goals to achieve with CBD and the reason to use it. It is highly recommended visiting your pharmacist\\doctor first, even if you know that CBD is totally safe.

Listen to the advice of professional, even if he or she is not quite familiar with CBD fully, they might give helpful advice on how to choose safe and legal products on such an unregulated market.

Start with low doses of CBD in order to help your body understand what is going on and take an effect. Then you should regularly increase dose to see which amount might fit you. Even if there is no effect in time after using, don’t get nervous - it is alright, every human body is individual and may interact with CBD in its own way. What’s more, track every CBD you consume, so it's gonna be easier for you to record results and see what amount is acceptable for you. Remember, your health is your most important concern, take your time while trying something new and listen to your body in order to have positive results and check everything twice before buying, because you can get in serious trouble.\n\n#### Bottom line.\n\nAny treatment has their own strengths and weaknesses. Even if you feel like to try something new in a good purpose, without a help of a specialist, it may cause severe trouble.
