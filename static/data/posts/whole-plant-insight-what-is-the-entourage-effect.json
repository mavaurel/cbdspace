  "content": "The industry of hemp is growing now as one of the quickest and most popular natural sector industries around the globe. These days law around hemp derived products is changing, and they become much more accessible. After the [2018 farm bill](https://cbdspace.io/2018-farm-bill-and-what-it-means-for-cbd-industry/), that allowed producing and selling hemp on the territory of the United States(but only for licensed growers and if the amount of THC in the plant does not exceed 0.3%), CBD products almost instantly flooded the stalls of your favorite stores, and even specific CBD stores were opened.\n\nThe diversity of products available for consumers is even more interesting - everything from creams, lotions, vape juices, to different edibles and CBD patches. Furthermore, not only products are different, but the labels itself - some say full spectrum CBD, or broad spectrum, some say CBD isolate.\n\nAfter that, the overall trend on CBD has only increased, and there are serious reasons for that. The first one is incredible therapeutic potential and possibility to treat certain issues like depression, anxiety, skin problems, PTSD, heart-related problems, some forms of pain and much more.\n\nTons of researches and lab tests are being made to discover CBD full potential, and it is only a matter of time till we see all the benefits and overall effectiveness. The second main reason is the abundance of products available and the fact that they’re pretty easy to access and use. The possibility of CBD to become a serious supplement to your daily medication or even a standalone treatment is kind of promising.\n\nHowever, not so many of you see cannabis as a complex plant with a lot of opportunities to benefit your health. Most of you know hemp and marijuana as two primary cannabis classifications, as well as CBD and THC, as the primary cannabinoids, that are found in cannabis plant in different amounts. Anyway, things aren’t as easy as they look. As we noted before, cannabis plant is more complex than you thing.\n\nTo the moment, it is known, that cannabis plant consists of more of a hundred different cannabinoids, and scientists are trying to prove their therapeutic effectiveness in case of your health issues. As for today, we are going to give you the firm material on why you should consider consuming not only isolated CBD products, and what is the “entourage effect”, in particular?\n\nFirst of all, let’s get to the basics and answer some simple questions about our compounds. So, what are CBD and THC and how they behave in our bodies?\n\n#### Basics: What is CBD and how does it work?\n\nCBD stands for cannabidiol, the second major chemical compound found in the cannabis flower. CBD cannot get you high in any ways, or no matter how much you used, because it works different than THC. Every one of us has an endocannabinoid system, which is responsible for making our own cannabinoids to maintain overall wellness and regulation of appetite, mood, memory, pain sensitivity and immune system.\n\nIt’s kind a biological pathway that contacts with our common body functions. CBD molecules interact with receptors in our endocannabinoid system known as CB1 and CB2, but it does not replace our natural neurotransmitters because of its shape, so CBD binds to these receptors instead in order to help produce much more cannabinoids and maintain your natural body rhythms.\n\nAccording to several studies, CBD claimed to be a possible treatment for some [conditions](https://cbdspace.io/what-are-the-uses-of-cbd-will-it-work-for-me/), such as anxiety, depression, epilepsy, insomnia, heart-related problems, etc. It is usually being extracted from a hemp plant and fortunately, according to the 2018 farm bill, it is now allowed to grow hemp with the amount of THC up to 0,3% on the territory of the United States, but only if you are a licensed grower.\n\nFurthermore, some states still prohibit to grow any cannabis, so be aware, check if it is legal in your area. On top of that, CBD was reported to be totally safe in its pure state, so if you are looking for some natural health support without any psychoactivity, it is probably for you, but you should consult with your doctor or pharmacist first, because it may interact with your daily medication and body in general. The next thing to determine THC and why is it allegedly worse even if they are parts of the same plant?\n\n#### Basics: What is THC and how it works?\n\nBasically, it is a first major compound of cannabis plant. It is much better known than CBD because of its wide history, but today we are going to talk only about its medical properties, not recreational use. THC is responsible for the most of psychoactivity in cannabis and that is the biggest drawback of using it. Unlike CBD, THC doesn’t bind to our receptors but hijacks them.\n\nThe shape of THC molecules is quite similar to our neurotransmitters in ECS called anandamide, so THC just tries to replace them and that makes us feel the “high” state. Simply put, THC mimics these neurotransmitters in order to regulate our perception of pain, eating habits and other functions by itself in a not healthy way.\n\nDue to the high psychoactive properties of THC, it is not safe in general way and mostly illegal in many countries, but for example some state laws of America allow growing and selling marijuana though. However, some THC products are being used in a medicine because of its therapeutic properties, usually to relieve some types of pain, inflammations and other conditions that need strong relaxants and quick relief effects. You are probably thinking of why it is still a thing if we have CBD instead?\n\nThat’s a good question. We may say, that overall trend on smoking marijuana has been reduced in time, but for now it is mainly used not alone, but with other cannabinoids of cannabis plant, and it is time to get familiar with whole plant product types, such as full spectrum and broad spectrum CBD, before we can get to our main question.\n\n### What are the whole plant products? Understanding full spectrum and broad spectrum CBD.\n\nThe term “full spectrum” is used to describe an extract, containing full range of existing cannabinoids of cannabis plant. For those of you, who are not familiar with CBD or other cannabinoids, it may look strange, but excluding CBD and THC there are more than a hundred different cannabinoids that cannabis plant consists of.\n\nFurthermore, full spectrum products do not only consist of just cannabinoids. Alongside with CBD, THC, CBG, CBN and other cannabinoids come terpenes, flavonoids and other natural materials. Full spectrum products may be purchased as other CBD products available like pills, e-juices, ointments, etc. However, we know that on the territory of the United States it is only legal to produce hemp, that contains up to 0.3% of THC in it.\n\nIt means, that all these full spectrum products are usually being extracted from high CBD and low THC hemp plants, not the marijuana ones. It won’t make you high, because the amount of THC in this kind of products is quite small. As for broad spectrum products, they are something in the middle between full-spectrum and isolate. An authentic broad spectrum product usually contains 0% THC, but carries some other cannabinoids that cannabis plant has, as well as terpenes and other natural compounds. Unlike the usual extraction methods, mostly CO2 based, it is much complicated to make a broad product.\n\nSometimes, isolates are being mixed up with little amounts of full range products in order to add other cannabinoids and terpenes to the mix. This product is an ideal choice for those who are totally against THC, or being drug tested a lot at work, or even if its completely illegal at your area.\n\nHowever, the methods broad products being made are pretty complicated and you should try to observe all the information about the product you are going to buy, every brand must be transparent about what their products consist of, and we personally recommend to look through the lab test results of a product you want to buy to be verified and know actually what’s in your possible daily supplement.\n\nAs you may notice, we’re finally heading to our main question - why it can be beneficial to use whole plant extracts, and not only CBD alone? What is the so called “entourage effect?”\n\n## What is the entourage effect, after all? Why is it so important?\n\nThe whole principle of entourage effect stands for all the cannabinoids working together while getting into the body. Simply put, the combination of many cannabinoids offers superior benefits than consuming single isolated compound. In your body they behave as one whole thing, synergizing effects of each other, to increase the overall effectiveness of a product.\n\nFor example, CBD and THC consumed together will help each other, while you will get the benefits of THC, CBD impact will reduce the psychoactive effects of compound. However, not all the interactions between certain compounds are 100% clear, but we guess that it is only a matter of time till we see all the potential you may get with the entourage effect. As for now, it is better seeking terpene and cannabinoid rich CBD, made of high CBD strain hemp, no matter full or broad spectrum.\n\nEven if the origin of this effect is clear for you, it doesn’t mean you should immediately purchase and start using this or that CBD. This material is given to you as a starting point of what you can get from different forms of CBD. We know, that many of you want to try CBD for yourself, and we don’t recommend doing anything without a proper connection with your doctor, because it is still unknown, how CBD can [interact with your medication](https://cbdspace.io/cbd-and-drug-interactions-is-it-dangerous/) and other aspects.\n\nHowever, we know that not all the doctors are familiar with CBD fully, and probably will only give you some advice on how you should choose these products and what will be good for your body. As for dosing, we did a slight research on how you may start calculating your CBD at the beginning.\n\n### Dosage advice.\n\nThere are no best options on your way of discovering benefits of CBD, everything is individual and may vary from person to person. Choosing your optimal dosage depends not only on how much you weight or the condition you treat, but also on a certain amount of CBD in any product you take.\n\nFor example, several CBD product like gummies or pills tell you how much CBD you are going to consume with a single serving. It might be labeled, that there is a 10 mg per capsule or gummy in the bottle so it is gonna be rather easier for you to track how much you consume. If you use a so called CBD tincture, it comes in a dropper bottle, and the label may say how much of CBD is in a single drop, but as it usually is, there is a total amount of CBD listed on the label.\n\nFrom that point, what should I do to know how much CBD is consumed? There’s nothing to worry about. Let’s do the simple maths. One drop is about 0.05 milliliters (ml). This means that a 10 ml bottle of CBD oil contains 200 drops. And if the label on that 10 ml bottle says that the bottle contains 1000 mg of CBD, each drop will contain about 5 mg of CBD. So, to have 20 mg of that form of CBD oil, you should take four drops.\n\nThis is a starting information for those, who are lacking knowledge or didn’t get proper guidance from their pharmacists. Even though, we do not personally recommend trying self treatment and sharing this information only in educational purposes. Always pay attention to what are you doing and be accurate with your health.\n\n#### Bottom line.\n\nWhile the market is not regulated enough, and there are a lot of untrusted information floating on the internet, it is most important to know what you are doing and pay attention to everything you try in case of natural treatments. That’s why in our articles we are trying to give you all the information needed to make your own research. Start thinking of your health first, and don’t make any hasty decisions, because in some cases it may cost you health. We hope that you will get our message and see our article only as a personal starting guide and nothing more, because we’re just humans who have opportunity to help other interested in CBD. Stay tuned for more guides and articles, and of course don’t forget to share if you liked.\\*\\*",
