  "content": "The industry of hemp is growing now as one of the quickest and most popular natural sector industries around the globe. These days law around hemp derived products is changing, and they become much more accessible. After the [2018 farm bill](/2018-farm-bill-and-what-it-means-for-cbd-industry/), that allowed producing and selling hemp on the territory of the United States(but only for licensed growers and if the amount of THC in the plant does not exceed 0.3%), CBD products almost instantly flooded the stalls of your favorite stores, and even specific CBD stores were opened. \n\nThe diversity of products available for consumers is even more interesting - everything from creams, lotions, vape liquids, to different edibles and special sublingual tinctures. Furthermore, not only products are different, but the labels itself - some say full-spectrum CBD, some say CBD isolate. \n\nAfter that, the overall trend on CBD has only increased, and there are serious reasons for that. The first one is incredible therapeutic potential and possibility of CBD to treat certain issues like depression, anxiety, skin problems, PTSD, ADHD, heart-related problems, some forms of pain and much more. \n\nTons of researches and lab tests are being made to discover CBD full potential, and it is only a matter of time till we see all the benefits and overall effectiveness. The second main reason is the abundance of products available and the fact that they’re pretty easy to access and use. The possibility of CBD to become a serious supplement to your daily medication or even a standalone treatment is kind of promising. \n\nAs we mentioned before, there are lots of ways of how you can use your CBD and what for, but it doesn’t mean, that the work of understanding CBD for yourself stays clear. Fortunately, we want to give you some useful material that you can begin with this hard job. As for today, particularly, we are going to discuss some of the most popular uses of CBD, that can help you with certain health issues, and of course about methods of using it. \n\nEven though, we should start with understanding the most common facts, so called “basics” about CBD and how does it behave in your body. Without any further ado, what is CBD and how it works?\n\n## Basics: What is CBD, and how does it work?\n\nFirst of all, CBD abbreviation stands short for cannabidiol and represents one of the primary compounds found in \\[Tooltip]cannabis plant\\[Tooltip]. As for his nearest cousins, you have probably heard of THC, the primary psychoactive compound of cannabis. Unlike THC, CBD can’t get you to the “high” state no matter how much and how long you use, because it just works differently. CBD is usually being extracted from the hemp plant, which is only one legal strain of hemp in the U.S. if the amount of THC in it not higher than 0,3%, so, officially, it cannot get you to the altered state in any ways. \n\nIt can be consumed in various [forms](/how-do-i-take-cbd/). For example, you may inhale it by vaping CBD infused liquids, or eat infused edibles like gummy bears or pills, or even take it topically with creams and lotions, but the most popular method across users is taking it sublingually, getting special tinctures under your tongue. It is clear, you may choose any of it depending on your demands and reasons, and we’ll discuss these methods a bit late, but how does CBD work in general? \n\nEvery one of us has its own endocannabinoid system(ECS), which is a complex of receptors giving signals to our body and produces cannabinoids to support \\[Tooltip]homeostasis\\[Tooltip] and our overall wellness. The ECS is responsible for regulation of many functions in our body: immunity, mood, memory, appetite, etc. For example, the thing known as “runner’s high” is a result of working ECS. \n\nEndocannabinoid system has receptors, that either CBD or THC interact with, CB1 and CB2. Unlike THC, CBD due to its shape doesn’t try to replace our natural \\[Tooltip]neurotransmitters\\[Tooltip] called anandamide, but just binds to these receptors producing much more cannabinoids to maintain our natural body rhythms. The exact ways of how CB1 and CB2 receptors affect on our brains isn’t fully understood so there are still more to study and research. According to studies, CBD is claimed to be absolutely safe in its pure state, but is there any evidence that it actually works, and how to use CBD oil?\n\n## The most popular uses and benefits of CBD.\n\nEven though, there are still not much strict information on how CBD functions in you body in case of certain health issues, the studies are going on every day, and to the moment we may say, that CBD might be successful as a natural supplement for some kinds of health problems. Let’s inspect the facts and analyze all the most popular issues, that CBD is used for. First of all, how to use CBD oil for pain relief?\n\n***Pain and Inflammation.***\n\nPain and inflammation relief are the most frequent uses of CBD according to the overall statistics. Several studies have found that CBD could be rather effective in case of different types of pain and inflammation.  \n\nFor example, there is a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5478794/), where CBD injections helped lab rats in reducing pain response to surgical incisions. It is believed, that CBD’s pain relieving effects come from its interactions with the endocannabinoid system(ECS). \n\nAnother [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4851925/) in the European Journal of Pain used a topical gel infused with CBD on rats with arthritis for 4 days. Researchers concluded, that there was a large drop in inflammation and pain of rats during the experiment. It means, that those who are suffering from chronic back pains, for example, can get their daily relief via using CBD.  \n\nScientists compiled several reports and other researches to conclude that CBD is an effective treatment for this particular issue in adults. Even more material can be found [here](/does-cbd-help-with-pain/). On top of that, it is not likely for CBD to build up a \\[Tooltip]tolerance\\[Tooltip], so it wouldn’t be need to regularly increase a dose of it. \n\n***Anxiety.***\n\nAnxiety and depression are pretty typical mental health issues, that might have a very destructive impact on a person. Usually they are being treated with various pharmaceutical drugs, but that kind of long-term treatment can cause numerous [side effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4970636/) such as insomnia, headaches, erectile dysfunction, etc. \n\nNational Institute on Drug Abuse stated in their [study](https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/legislative-activities/testimony-to-congress/2015/biology-potential-therapeutic-effects-cannabidiol), that CBD was pretty effective in reducing anxiety symptoms in rats behavior. For other forms of anxiety such as social anxiety disorder(SAD) and post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD) CBD was also claimed to be positive in use.  \n\nA 2011 [study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0269881110379283)’s participants were given either CBD or a \\[Tooltip]placebo\\[Tooltip] and as a result, people who used CBD instead of placebo experienced visible reduce of anxiety. Meanwhile, researches on PTSD concluded that CBD might become a standalone treatment or a supplement to existing medications. \n\nSo it is likely for CBD to show positive results in treating anxiety issues and its qualities give CBD an opportunity to help people who suffer from various forms of anxiety. Speaking of CBD oil for depression, it is believed that according to CBD’s positive effect on serotonin level in the brain, it is likely to be helpful in dealing with depression.  \n\nAlthough, it isn’t backed by many studies and there’s only couple of them, saying that anti-stress effects of CBD should be handy with treating depression symptoms, so it still needs time to discover full potential of CBD in case of depression. If you want to know more about CBD and anxiety - don't forget to check [this](/does-cbd-work-for-anxiety/) out!\n\n***Heart and circulatory system.***  \n\nStudies indicate that CBD might be able to deal with some heart conditions including lower high blood pressure. Some recent [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5470879/) treated healthy men with dose of CBD and as a result it reduced their blood pressure.  \n\nDuring all these tests CBD’s properties appeared to be suitable for people with high \\[Tooltip]hypertension\\[Tooltip] levels. Moreover, some other animal study came with a conclusion that stress-reducing properties of CBD may help reduce symptoms associated with heart disease. \n\n***Acne Reduce.***\n\nAcne is one of the most common skin problems among people. It is caused by various number of reasons, including bacteria, genetics, overproduction of skin secretion, etc. Due to CBD’s anti-inflammatory properties it might be helpful in reducing sebum production, but is there any clues? Yes, it is!\n\n[Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25061872) claims that CBD prevented sebaceous cells from secreting sebum and induced an anti-inflammatory effect on a skin. It is promising to be one of the most efficient ways in treating acne, but of course before making a firm decision it needs more tests and researches. \n\n***Drug Addiction and Withdrawal.***\n\nOnce scientists suggested, that CBD could be influential in treating addictions and adverse effects of various substances such as THC, alcohol, opioid addiction, etc. The most famous [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23095052) on this showed a case of 19 year old woman who was treated with CBD for ten days to avoid and reduce her cannabis withdrawal syndrome and after that period results were highly positive. \n\nOther studies demonstrated that it might also be helpful for people with tobacco and \\[Tooltip]opioid\\[Tooltip] addictions. Researchers observed a total of 24 tobacco smokers who were given half placebo and a half of CBD vape inhalers, and the instruction was to used it when they feel like smoking a cigarette. Over a week participants who were treated with CBD reduced their needs in smoking cigarettes by more than 40 percent comparing to those who were given placebo, and obviously there was no difference before and after the experiment. \n\nIn other known study researchers recruited 42 people who were using heroin for more than 13 years in a row. After dividing them into three groups, they were given different quantities of CBD, and the third one was treated by a placebo. Results were quite promising, the first two groups experienced straight reduce of their anxiety and craving cause by their drug addiction, comparing to the placebo group. \n\n***Cancer-related symptoms.***\n\nWhile CBD is being comprehensively researched at the moment, scientists looked at some of its properties, that could be advantageous in treating some cancer-related symptoms like vomiting, nausea and pain.  Mostly, before the CBD came at the market, these problems were being treated with THC. One study considered the effectiveness of [CBD vs THC](/cbd-vs-thc-is-cbd-better/) in case of cancer issues. Those participants who were given full spectrum CBD with THC experienced a visible pain relief comparing to those who were treated with only THC extract. \n\nMost of the modern medication is quite ineffective for cancer and chemotherapy side effects, but CBD appeared to reduce nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy.  On top of that, many animal studies showed possibility for CBD to even kill cancer cells, but it just slightly worked for lab mice and it is really unlikely for now to cure cancer with it, though there is more to explore about these properties of CBD. \n\n***Insomnia***\n\nSuch thing like insomnia and bad sleep habits can be caused by various factors. Everything from your mental health issues to some physical conditions could disturb your sleep cycle. There’s still no firm answer to question how CBD helps to sleep well, but this surprisingly works.  \n\nMost of the researches are focused on insomnia caused by different things like pain, anxiety and sleep cycle problems. To the moment it all looks very promising, because insomnia is a wide-range problem of a modern society, and possibility of having safe treatment for it is really hopeful.  As for now, if you have some sleep problems, you may try CBD, but be aware that the effect is not immediate and take time to feel your body rhythms.\n\nIn summary, this is not a complete list of CBD uses, but some material, that was analyzed by our team and backed up by some science. To the moment, it is clear, that CBD might be rather beneficial, but the biggest problem is, that it depends on some individual things and various aspects, that are pretty complicated to take into consideration.\n\n## So, the advantage is clear to me, but what is the best way to consume CBD?\n\n We can firmly say, that there is no “best option” in choosing ways of how you are going to use your products. Basically, there are four primary methods of how you can use CBD: sublingual(under your tongue), topical(on the skin), orally(by eating) and inhale(by vaping or smoking).  All these methods are equally getting in your body and interact with \\[Tooltip]endocannabinoid system\\[Tooltip]. \n\nNevertheless, each one has its own difference between like effect duration and how long does it take to start working. Every method has its strengths and weaknesses, and if you are into trying CBD for whatever issue you have, it is up to you, how are you going to use it, because it depends on so many factors. For example, habitual smokers prefer most vaping CBD, because it represents their habit, but some really enjoy cooking with CBD oils, and there are more and more examples. \n\nThat is the key, because you may choose whatever method you like, depending on your body feelings and results. However, we do not recommend trying anything before speaking with a specialist(doctor\\pharmacist, because CBD production is a still new thing to the industry, and nobody knows how it may interact with your medication, for example.  Some people, that already use CBD ask us about their feelings, and especially about lack of them. What should I do, if I don’t feel CBD even works for me?\n\n## What if CBD doesn’t work for me?\n\nThere is nothing scary, if you don’t feel the effect of CBD to come, because there are some serious reasons for it. First thing to mention, CBD unlike THC doesn’t have any psychoactive properties. It means that no matter how much you gonna take CBD, it could not get you high anyway. It is not mind altering, so the effects is gonna be much less visible and time dependent.  \n\nMost of the CBD users report that in some time they started to feel less nervous, their sleep has improved and their pains were lesser in complex. If you don’t feel anything while taking CBD for a while, you should remember, that every person have his or her own body and it could interact differently with each one of them. Maybe you should change your dosage in order to understand your body and how it feels of CBD.  \n\nAlways check your CBD source, because the one thing that fits one’s demands, may not fit other’s. Moreover, you should think of various forms of taking CBD like tinctures, gummies, vapes, etc.  Be patient and take your time to experiment during time with all these instructions, the result will not be momentary, so it is up to you to find the optimal condition for your wellness. The last thing is, don’t force yourself if it bothers you in uncomfortable way. \n\n## Bottom line.\n\nNo matter which path you choose, if it’s going to benefit your health.
