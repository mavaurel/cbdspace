  "content": "The legal status of CBD is a pretty complicated and unclear thing, because it changes pretty rapidly on every federal level. Tons of people all over the world already use CBD for various purpose from treating some pain conditions to recreational use. It is rather important for people to know that CBD is legal, because it gives easy access to products they can use on a daily basis and nobody wants to get in trouble because of it. CBD becomes a pretty mainstream thing nowadays and can be found in many products like oils, creams, tinctures and edibles of all kinds, so even if you are just interested in its legality, this article will be still helpful to you and those who are already in the club to outline all the basics linked with legal status of CBD products. So, let’s make the surrounding landscape a bit more clear starting with defining on what CBD is and why should it be legal in any ways.\n\n## First things first, let’s talk about CBD\n\nCBD is one of many compounds found in cannabis plant and is short for cannabidiol. Unlike his cousin THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, which is responsible for the psychoactivity, CBD can’t get you “high” and derived directly from hemp plant. Every person on the planet has endocannabinoid system(ECS), a molecular signaling system that produces its own cannabinoids and is responsible for our immunity, mood, memory, appetite and more. CBD interacts with some receptors in endocannabinoid system to produce more cannabinoids and maintain overall wellness and homeostasis. For example, the thing known as “runner’s high” is a result of a working ECS. Its medical potential is a key reason of why CBD is so popular on the market right now. Studies and researches say that CBD might be helpful with treating some medical conditions like depression, anxiety, arthritis pain, insomnia, heart-related problems, etc. CBD may be consumed in any ways starting with vaping CBD infused liquids, using massage creams, eating CBD edibles and much more. Despite the fact that CBD might become pretty beneficial for tons of people’s conditions it is still being comprehensively studied and not legal in every country. Many of you are struggling with questions like “is CBD weed?”, so it’s our work to make it clear for you in the next paragraph.\n\n## What’s the difference between CBD and Cannabis itself?\n\nFirst of all, the term “cannabis” is a general word for all the plants that exist in cannabis family. The key thing about these plants is how much one or another contains THC. From that point we may differentiate these plants in two categories, marijuana and hemp. CBD may be extracted from both of them, but the key thing is the amount of THC in the plant. For example, most all of the marijuana strains contain large amounts of THC escalating to 32%. Unlike marijuana, hemp plants contain less than 0.3% of THC and in order for CBD to be legal, it must be produced from hemp, according to U.S. federal law. Now we came to a point, where we can differentiate CBD from other cannabis strains, but if it’s containment of THC is so low, is it legal everywhere? Let’s check and find out!\n\n## What’s the overall legality status of CBD around the world?\n\nUnfortunately, as well as cannabis, CBD is illegal in most of the countries around the world. The fact that CBD is an extract from the cannabis plant makes the situation more complicated, because this way filled with lots of regulation and not everybody may grow it and produce properly. Every country has its own laws and all the things about cannabis always were pretty foggy. Talking about CBD, it is currently legal in some countries including UK, Canada, most of the Europe and America, so let’s take a closer look on how CBD became legal on the territory of the United States and what do the American laws think about it.\n\n## So, what about the U.S.? Is it completely legal to use CBD there?\n\nMajorly speaking, according to the 2018 farm bill<sup id=\"ref_1\">[1](#note_1)</sup> it is currently legal on a federal level to grow, produce, and sell industrial hemp on the territory of the United States. However, it is linked with some rules in industrial hemp growing that must be followed in order to be legal: only licensed farmers may grow these plants, and the major rule is that the containment of THC in their product must be less than 0.3%. So, there are more doors to open towards the 2018 farm bill, but at the moment we know, that hemp-derived products now don’t associate as a schedule 1 substances, and completely legal and safe if cultivated by a licensed grower or farmer. Additionally, according to this document, it is clear that a licenced grower may extract any cannabinoids from the hemp plant if it was produced consistently with federal and state laws. \n\nWhat does it mean for a consumer? Simply put, if CBD product you buy contains legitimate amount of THC but wasn’t produced by a licensed grower, it is still totally illegal. To the moment, it is now FDA(Food and Drug Administration) of the United States who is responsible for the following regulation of CBD and linked products. This organization already approved medical treatment infused with CBD for severe forms of epilepsy called Epidiolex but still considers that CBD is a drug ingredient that can’t be marketed as a dietary supplement with therapeutic properties without getting a proper approval process at the FDA’s, so this rule spreads on any hemp-derived product. You have probably seen all these products on the market claiming to beat your anxiety, depression, relieve all kinds of pain and even cure cancer, but is it barely relevant to the truth? The truth is, that none of these products still have been proven to be as effective as it is being advertised. The FDA agency is trying to consider all the circumstances and regulate CBD products officially. Although, it doesn’t mean that CBD products aren’t working at all, and millions of people reporting some results of daily usage, so it is only a matter of time when the FDA will have their official verdict on that. \n\nWhat’s the opinion of the state laws? Despite the fact, that the farm bill made some changes in overall law of the United States, some cities and states still updating their laws. For example, Colorado approved to use all parts of hemp plants as a food ingredient with therapeutic use, while any amount of THC product are still illegal on the territory of Texas. \n\n## When the rules on CBD are so strict, how to find safe and approved products on the market? \n\nWith all these local and federal laws being worked on, finding good and safe product becomes a pretty hard job to do. You should check everything twice before buying, because not all of the manufacturers are completely honest with you and if you want to lower all the legality risk, you must be comprehensive in your research. Here are some simple rules you should follow in order to avoid any troubles:\n\n﻿\n* **Certification:** Any CBD product should be approved by a document known as COA, it shows that lab tested and checked for the potency(the confirmed amount of CBD and THC in the product that listed on the label). Moreover, the batch number of COA should match the one on the label. All this information on the product should be easily found according to the local and state laws, it should make your choice more verified on a certain product.\n* **Testing:** Any tests on a CBD products must meet with\"ISO 17025\"standards and also be validated with one of the official regulatory organizations:U.S. Pharmacopeia, Association of Official Agricultural Chemists, or the American Herbal Pharmacopoeia.\n* **Where the hemp comes from?:** You should always check, that the hemp was produced by a licensed grower on the territory of the United States and fits all the agriculture laws, that will totally help you find the right product that might fulfill all your demands.\n\n## Bottom line\n\nCBD is a mainstream for now, but it doesn’t mean that it is completely legal everywhere. You always should be aware of the law especially when it spreads on buying questionable product, check twice and try to find as much information as it needs to be verified on product. Also, be sure with CBD’s legal status in your area in order to not to get in serious trouble. Hope you find this information useful, it is very important for our team.
