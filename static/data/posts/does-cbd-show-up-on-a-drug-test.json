  "title": "Does CBD show up on a drug test?",
  "content": "CBD products becoming mainstream at the moment, due to its natural medical properties, so millions of people around the globe use it on a daily basis to treat severe conditions like insomnia, anxiety, depression, acne, pain, and some heart-related problems. CBD is a second natural compound found in cannabis plant known as cannabidiol, the nearest cousin of THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, another major source of cannabis plant, which is known for being responsible of all psychoactive properties in the plant. Knowing that, tons of employees at all industries coming up with new questions when it comes to drug testing in their workplace. The most usual workplace drug tests don’t look for any CBD oil traces, because it’s never been found to cause destructive effects on a human body or any functions like memory or motor skills. However, most of the time workers fail drug tests on THC, that can be contained in low amounts in CBD products. When it comes to labeling products, manufacturers might misstate the actual amount of THC contained in a certain product, that may be caused by a crucial mistake or an evil intent of manufacturers. All this happens due to a largely unregulated marketing control. These problems may direct you to a danger zone of failing as drug test and even losing your income or job. So, the main question of today’s talk is “can CBD show up on a drug test in any way?”.\n\n## Can I fail a drug test for CBD?\n\nThe answer is as easy as it is complicated. You can't fail a drug test due to CBD, but you may fail it for any remaining THC found in your body. Let’s analyze it deeper, here’s how the test works: employers collect samples, mostly urine, and send them to a drug testing organizations who run them through their machines measuring traces of any chemicals. If these companies find any amount of THC in the liquid, according to the federal law, you will fail a drug test. There’s also a possibility of misidentifying CBD products as THC, but that’s only because of the outdated methods of drug testing, so the verdict may be appealed. So, it is more likely to fail the test because of the untrusted CBD products and not of CBD itself. If you are already aware of this, there are some questions above. How long does CBD stays in my body? It’s a good question, but, unfortunately there’s no satisfactory research yet claiming how long CBD can stay in a human body. However, there are a little studies<sup id=\"ref_1\">[1](#note_1)</sup> showing that it remains in your system for about a week. On the other hand, scientists are more informed about how long THC may stay in your body. Curiously, it depends on how often you use THC. If you are just familiar with it consume THC infrequently, it takes only few days to get rid of THC traces completely. In contrast to, habitual users bodies take much more time to deal with THC, one month or even longer. You should also keep in mind, that your hair as well as urine keeps a record of every chemical you ingest. For example, hair test in despite of urine test can detect traces of THC even after 90 days of sobriety. So, why is there THC in my body, I’m using just CBD isolates.\n\n### Why is there THC in my body?\n\nAll the cannabis plants produce both CBD and THC, so, medical cannabis and industrial hemp are cousins, that produce several compounds called cannabinoids. The hemp plant is federally legal on the territory of the United States, but it still may contain up to 0.3% of THC in the plant. Simply put, if you use very high doses of CBD on a daily basis, you may also have a little portion of THC in your body, so you hypothetically may fail a drug test at your workplace. On top of that, if you usually buy untrusted products, you may encounter mislabeling, saying that there’s no THC in your product at all, but it is easily may be a lie. If you want to be verified in your product and avoid any troubles connected with accidental THC exposure, you should buy and consume only licensed, third-party tested products in order to be accurate with labels and amounts of chemicals in the product. In other words, how much CBD could make me fail a drug test?\n\n### How much CBD will make me fail a drug test?\n\nNow we know, it is not CBD that can make you fail a drug test, but THC. You may fail it due to the CBD usage only because of small amount of reasons, it depends on a source of CBD you use, over how long, how much and other factors. If you take an isolate product on a daily basis, it shouldn’t contain a THC in any condition. However, the quality of CBD products is varying, and every one of it is being extracted from hemp plant that by law may contain up to 0.3% of THC. So, from time to time the number can be higher, and can be detected in your drug test. As we have said before, if you use high-THC products every day and stop in order to pass the drug test, you may still fail it within a month or longer. As for CBD, you theoretically can use it for month without getting in trouble on THC, however it still depends on a source and how high is your everyday dosage, so be aware, that might get you fired. So, if you are concerned about your future drug testing and you are a habitual user, you should follow some detoxification methods in order to prepare for your workplace drug tests. There’s also a rumor online claiming that stomach acid may convert your CBD into THC, but that is a total hoax. According to certain studies and experts opinion there is no real evidence of stomach acid doing these things, so you may calm down and be wise in your choice. One more important thing to know, that you must be really aware of what you buy, because there are tons of bad marketers hunting for your money, so you may not know whether label with amounts of CBD and THC telling the truth, and that is our next topic to talk about.\n\n### So, how can I choose a safe product that won’t get me into a serious trouble during the drug testing?\n\nThe CBD industry is swiftly growing and becoming a mainstream at the moment, so there are lots of money attracted to it and tons of companies are already selling millions of CBD products. However, due to the bad regulations and lack of study, there still some people who just don’t care about your health and wellness, so the main thesis is to keep out from that type of CBD companies, but how to do it properly?

Other things that you should consider, is a lab testing.
