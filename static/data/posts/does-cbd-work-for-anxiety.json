  "content": "Most of you have probably heard of the new product on the market known as CBD. It is still hard to believe, that CBD flooded the stalls that rapidly. The major reason for it is various beneficial therapeutic properties of CBD. Everything from oils and \\[Tooltip]tinctures\\[Tooltip], pills, vape liquids and edibles of all kinds are already available to buy for consumers. It is claimed that CBD might be helpful with severe kinds of diseases starting from anxiety\\depression and ending with heart-related problems as well as some kinds of pain. \n\nThere are tons of studies actively trying do discover all the therapeutic potential of CBD, but we already have some strong evidence of its effectiveness in helping with treating specific health issues. However, many of you still questioning CBD does even work for certain health problems or recreational use. Today we are going to talk particularly on how CBD might help you with anxiety disorder, but at first, let’s determine the commons connected with CBD in general. Basically, what is CBD and how does it work?\n\n## What is CBD?\n\nCBD stands short for cannabidiol, one of the major compounds in cannabis plant. You probably know his nearest cousin THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, which is responsible for the psychoactivity of cannabis. Unlike THC, CBD can’t get you to the “high” state no matter how much you use, because it works other than his cousin and brought to you from the \\[Tooltip]hemp plant\\[Tooltip].\n\nOn the territory of the United States it is officially legal to produce hemp and extract CBD only if it was grown by a licensed grower and the amount of THC in it does not outreach 0.3%. It is completely safe in a pure state and may be consumed in various [forms](https://cbdspace.io/how-do-i-take-cbd/). \n\nFor example, you may inhale it by vaping CBD infused liquids, or eat infused edibles like gummy bears or pills, or even take it topically with creams and lotions, but the most popular method across users is taking it sublingually, getting special tinctures under your tongue. It is clear, you may choose any of it depending on your demands and reasons, but how does it work in general?\n\n## How does CBD work?\n\nEvery one of us has its own endocannabinoid system(ECS), which is a complex of receptors giving signals to our body and produces cannabinoids to maintain \\[Tooltip]homeostasis\\[Tooltip] and our overall wellness. The ECS is responsible for regulation of many functions in our body: immunity, mood, memory, appetite, etc. For example, the thing known as “runner’s high” is a result of working ECS. \n\nEndocannabinoid system has receptors, that either CBD or THC interact with, CB1 and CB2. Unlike THC, CBD due to its shape doesn’t try to replace our natural \\[Tooltip]neurotransmitters\\[Tooltip] called anandamide, but just binds to these receptors producing much more cannabinoids to maintain our natural body rhythms. The exact ways of how CB1 and CB2 receptors affect on our brains isn’t fully understood so there are still more to study and research. \n\nThe thing which is known for sure - is the place of serotonin in all this work. Serotonin - is an important neurotransmitter which plays a key role in our mental health. It is usual to associate low serotonin levels with depression and it may cause anxiety as well. From that point we are heading to discussion on how CBD effects on anxiety and does it really help with treating this issue?\n\n## CBD and anxiety, does it help?\n\nTalking of CBD treatment for anxiety, there are several studies indicating possibility of potential benefits of treating it. For example, National Institute on Drug Abuse, or NIDA, did a research<sup id=\"ref_1\">[1](#note_1)</sup> showed that CBD reduced overall stress in animals. Rats with symptoms of anxiety were treated with CBD and observed to have lesser behavioral signs of anxiety. \n\nFurthermore, their psychological symptoms and a heart rate also improved pretty quickly. So, these hopeful results telling us that CBD has a good potential in treating anxiety, but this certain study was done to discover an opportunity to treat generalized anxiety disorder, or GAD. There are still more to study on it, but anxiety has many other forms, so let’s see what do the scientists say on them.\n\nThere are such forms of anxiety as SAD, or social anxiety disorder, and PTSD, or post-traumatic stress disorder, and it is likely for CBD to be helpful with these types of anxiety as well. Talking of social anxiety disorder, there is a 2011 study<sup id=\"ref_2\">[2](#note_2)</sup> researching how CBD might affect on people with SAD. Participants were given either 400 mg CBD or a placebo. \n\nThe results were quite satisfying, those who were given CBD reported reducing anxiety levels. It means, that people with SAD might find a relief from their symptoms in CBD. As for post-traumatic stress disorder, there are multiple studies<sup id=\"ref_3\">[3](#note_3)</sup>, that demonstrated how CBD may get a relief from a PTSD symptoms like nightmare or replaying negative memories. \n\nMoreover, researchers looked at CBD not only as a standalone treatment, but a supplement to a daily medication for PTSD as well. However, all these studies are not being controlled properly, so there are not much evidence to show strict relief from a certain symptoms. For other neurological disorders there are quite little studies, concluding that CBD might become a good treatment for schizophrenia, but was pretty useless for depression during the studies. \n\nWe should better understand how CBD works in order to make proper experiments and make straight decisions. However, if you feel like trying CBD for your anxiety, we need to hit the topic of dosing and buying safe CBD first to make everything less complicated for you on this pathway. So what is the normal dose of CBD for my anxiety?\n\n## Dosage advice.\n\nGenerally, if you feel like using CBD for your anxiety, we strongly recommend consulting with your pharmacist or doctor first. Even though that CBD doesn’t have critical side effects, any CBD product may [interact](https://cbdspace.io/cbd-and-drug-interactions-is-it-dangerous/) with your daily medication and your health is the first you must pay attention at. \n\nFurthermore, some people reported to experience other slight side effects of CBD, such as fatigue, diarrhea, and various changes in weight in appetite. Fortunately, it is an individual issue, although we still recommend you visiting your doctor before making any decisions by yourself, they should help you find proper dose of CBD personally. \n\nDespite giving you the so called disservice, we are going to share with you some information we know for sure. Firstly, we know that only few products on the market may get you enough CBD to be beneficial. As for [dosage](https://cbdspace.io/cbd-dosage-guide-how-much-should-i-take/), there was a good example - an experiment, where participants with anxiety were given either \\[Tooltip]placebo\\[Tooltip] or CBD before speaking in public. As a result, people who were given CBD instead of a placebo experienced a good relief from their symptoms during speaking. \n\nThe dose of CBD they consumed orally was 300mg, so we might conclude it is a normal starting dose for a person. However, this industry is not being regulated properly, so we are not sure if you are going to succeed with self-treatment. After talking to your doctor and making the final decision, you should know that not every product on the market is safe and you should be aware of what you need to do in order to buy an approved and pure product, so we made some tips for you to make your choice wiser.\n\n## How to find safe CBD on the market?\n\nThe federal law on growing hemp is still quite in progress, so we know that the market is not being regulated properly, and you should check twice before buying anything. Even if [choosing CBD ](https://cbdspace.io/how-to-choose-safe-and-approved-cbd-product/)is pretty hard job to do, we highlighted some things you should pay attention at in order to buy product that would fit all your demands and be safe and legal after all. Here is what you need to look at:\n\n* ***Certification:*** Any CBD product should be approved by a document known as COA, it shows that lab tested and checked for the potency(the confirmed amount of CBD and THC in the product that listed on the label). Moreover, the batch number of COA should match the one on the label. All this information on the product should be easily found according to the local and state laws, it should make your choice more verified on a certain product.\n* ***Testing:*** Any tests on a CBD products must meet with\"ISO 17025\"standards and also be validated with one of the official regulatory organizations:U.S. Pharmacopeia, Association of Official Agricultural Chemists, or the American Herbal Pharmacopoeia.\n* ***Where the hemp comes from?:*** You should always check, that the hemp was produced by a licensed grower on the territory of the United States and fits all the agriculture laws, that will totally help you find the right product that might fulfill all your demands.\n\nIf you are going to follow these simple tips, the job of choosing CBD will be a cakewalk.\n\n## Bottom line.\n\nAny treatment has their own strengths and weaknesses. Even if you feel like to try something new in a good purpose, without a help of a specialist, it may cause severe trouble. CBD is quite mainstream now, and we know that fact, but don’t let advertisers and marketers trick you with pretty words. Always try to check everything, it is your health and it should be in your priorities. In our articles we try to share with you some useful information, but it is not in a first instance. Trust specialists, and we hope that this article was functional for your thoughts. Stay tuned and don’t forget to share if you like.",
