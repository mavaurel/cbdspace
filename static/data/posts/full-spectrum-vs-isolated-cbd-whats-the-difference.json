  "content": "The industry of hemp growing is now one of the most quick and popular natural sector industries around the globe. These days law around hemp derived products is changing, and they become much more accessible. At the moment, the most popular hemp compound on the market is CBD and products infused with it. \n\nVarious oils, \\[Tooltip]tinctures\\[Tooltip] and edibles instantly flooded the stalls because of its therapeutic properties that can help with several medical conditions like pain, insomnia, anxiety, depression and some heart-related problems. Tons of scientists and researchers are still discovering the full medical potential of CBD, but all these products already spreaded across the United States and the choice between them becomes almost impossible. \n\nYou have probably seen all these labels saying “Full-Spectrum CBD”, “Broad Spectrum CBD” and “CBD Isolate”. We are going to break down these common terms and help you find the product that would fit all your possible demands in CBD. However, there are some things around to make clear for you before we get to our main questions. So, let’s check and find out what are CBD and THC in general!\n\n## Basically, what are CBD and THC and how these two can help me?\n\nFirst things first, CBD and THC are the two majorly studied compounds found in cannabis plant. CBD stands for cannabidiol, and THC for tetrahydrocannabinol. The main difference between these two is the fact, that THC is responsible for all psychoactivity in cannabis, but CBD is not psychoactive at all, an that means it cannot get you to the “high feel”. So, how does it work? \n\nInside any of you right now, there is a biological pathway called endocannabinoid system, or ECS. It is responsible for the regulation of your mood, appetite, immune system, pain sensitivity and memory. It produces our own cannabinoids to maintain our natural body rhythm and balance, known as \\[Tooltip]homeostasis\\[Tooltip]. Both CBD and THC hijack your endocannabinoid system, but interfere differently. \n\nThey interact with our main ECS receptors - CB1 and CB2. While THC molecules try to replace natural cannabinoids and get you high, without other special effects, CBD molecules form-factor helps them to bind to your endocannabinoid system and produce much more cannabinoids to maintain your overall wellness and health.  According to various studies CBD claimed to be a good treatment for some health conditions, and is totally [safe](https://cbdspace.io/is-cbd-safe-data-and-research/) in its pure state, but what full\\broad spectrum and isolate products feel like, let’s puzzle it out!\n\n## What is Full Spectrum CBD?\n\nAs we know, cannabis plants contain hundreds of \\[Tooltip]phytochemicals\\[Tooltip] and other compounds. [Full-spectrum CBD](https://cbdspace.io/what-is-full-spectrum-cbd-what-is-it-good-for/) products stand for the products that carry full range of cannabinoids found in the plant. It means when the cannabinoids are extracted from the hemp plant, is produced into a complete consumable product, containing healthy dose of all cannabinoids extracted from the plant. \n\nIt is also called “whole plant” product, meaning that nothing were lost during the extraction process. There is a key advantage of all full-spectrum products called entourage effect, the synergy between work of CBD and THC. Simply put, it helps to get all the THC advantages without getting much high with the help of CBD, and influence on your endocannabinoid system by binding to its receptors. \n\nThere’s also a study<sup id=\"ref_1\">[1](#note_1)</sup> claimed that the subjects that were given full-spectrum CBD experienced much better relief than ones were using isolates. However, if you live in a state, where’s THC is illegal, you won’t get the full-spectrum products without getting in trouble, so your choice gonna be isolated or broad-spectrum CBD products. \n\n## What is CBD Isolate?\n\nWhereas[ Isolate CBD](https://cbdspace.io/what-are-cbd-isolates-what-are-they-good-for/) is the most common form, it doesn’t mean that it is worse than others. Even more, researchers say, that it is likely for CBD to have the widest therapeutic range in a pure form. These products usually labeled as 99 or more pure CBD, it depends on the form it comes at markets. Although, it might look pretty basic, but it is actually much harder to isolate product from other \\[Tooltip]hemp compounds\\[Tooltip]. \n\nThere are much more extra steps in producing than in others, where the extract is being full of other compounds, so there is an additional process of removing all these. Due to the complicated creation process, it usually comes in powder-like products, but it’s also may be mixed with other forms, like gummies, topicals and oils. There’s also a so called “dabs”, that can be consumed by vaporizing compounds on a hot nail and inhaling the appeared vapor. \n\nIt’s like usual vaping, but you replace e-liquids and e-cigarettes with these dabs. However, this method isn’t for all so there are so many other forms of isolate to choose if you want to feel pure CBD properties or don’t have an opportunity to use full-spectrum products.\n\n## What is Broad Spectrum CBD?\n\nBroad spectrum products are something in the middle between full-spectrum and isolate. An authentic broad spectrum product usually contains 0% THC, but carries some other cannabinoids that cannabis plant has, as well as terpenes and other natural compounds. This product provides an \\[Tooltip]entourage effect\\[Tooltip] as well, without any amount of THC, so you may feel all the potential of natural cannabis compounds mixed up. \n\nUnlike the usual extraction methods, mostly CO2 based, it is much complicated to make a broad product. Sometimes, isolates are being mixed up with little amounts of full range products in order to add other cannabinoids and \\[Tooltip]terpenes\\[Tooltip] to the mix. This product is an ideal choice for those who are totally against THC, or being [drug tested](https://cbdspace.io/does-cbd-show-up-on-a-drug-test/) a lot at work, or even if its completely illegal at your area. \n\nHowever, the methods broad products being made are pretty complicated and you should try to observe all the information about the product you are going to buy, every brand must be transparent about what their products consist of, and we personally recommend to look through the lab test results of a product you want to buy to be verified and know actually what’s in your possible daily supplement. Sometimes it is kinda hard to find what may actually fit you and choose fine and totally safe product on the market, and that’s our next topic to speak about. \n\n## How to choose a product that would fit me?\n\nFirstly, we should determine how all these products may benefit your health and wellness particularly. As for full spectrum products, they are being advantageous in their complexity. Simply put, they contain many cannabinoids and other compounds, so it is possible to treat a wider range of health problems. \n\nMany studies show that potential of full spectrum products is a superior to an isolate ones, at least for inflammatory and other severe conditions. On the other hand, isolated products allow you to get large amounts of pure CBD and easily control your everyday dosage. \n\nMoreover, it is much closer to people who are pretty sensitive to other cannabinoids, THC, and other compounds that may be found in a hemp plant. Also, it might become a better choice for those who are distracted with taste of hemp, because you can mix it up with other flavors or different ways to use it, like edibles, for example. Due to the complexity of extraction of isolates it might be rather expensive than other CBD products so it is up to whether to choose this way or not. \n\nAdditionally, you will never know which product gonna fit you most without trying different variations, because every CBD product may [interact](https://cbdspace.io/cbd-and-drug-interactions-is-it-dangerous/) differently with your particular organism and type of condition. If your reaction on a certain product isn’t proper in the means of time, you should try another way or consult with your pharmacist first, which will be a better thing to do onwards. \n\n## Bottom line\n\nIt is still very early to say, that a certain type of CBD will be better than the others, because it needs much more research to unlock its full potential. However, there are already lots of health benefits even with a lack of study, there is a way for you to try and choose whether use full range or isolated products, or not. It isn’t necessary to think that a one product is better than others, because it’s a brand new specific industry, so you should try it yourself with the help of your doctor in order to make a right choice. We hope that information listed here will be useful for you, because we want to make your pathway through the world of CBD less stressful.
