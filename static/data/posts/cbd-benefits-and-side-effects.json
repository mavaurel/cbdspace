  "content": "Due to the changes in U.S. hemp-growing law recent years, a new product known as CBD has gained instant popularity among American consumers. Numerous products like tinctures, creams, vape oils and gummy bears infused with CBD are everywhere on the market right now. CBD stands for cannabidiol, an active source in cannabis sativa plant that can easily displace THC by reason of its beneficial properties. The main difference between these two is the fact, that CBD is not mind-altering and can’t cause any psychoactive effect on you, so it looks pretty appealing for those of you who wants to relieve some of their symptoms without the effects of THC. The fact, that CBD can’t get you high is not the only one beneficial thing about it. It interacts with your endocannabinoid system(ECS)<sup id=\"ref_1\">[1](#note_1)</sup>, which is involved in regulation of some functions in your organism, such as pain, appetite, sleep and response of an immune system. Several studies have shown that CBD could be really helpful in treating some medical issues, but is it as advantageous as it is being advertised, let’s learn and find it out!\n\n## How can CBD benefit my health?\n\nInstead of hijacking your endocannabinoid system as THC does, CBD binds to a different receptors, and helps them to work harder in order to make you feel better. Even though there are still not much information about how CBD functions, there are a lot of claims that it may help in treating particular medical issues:     \n\n* Pain and Inflammation\n* Anxiety and Depression     \n* Heart and circulatory system\n* Acne Reduce      \n* Drug addiction and withdrawal\n* Cancer-related problems\n* Insomnia\n\nOf course not all of these are supported by researches, because there is a lot much to study about CBD, let’s see what do the facts say about listed benefits.\n\n## Benefits\n\n### Pain and Inflammation\n\nPain and inflammation relief are the most frequent uses of CBD according to the overall statistics. Several studies have found that CBD could be rather effective in case of different types of pain and inflammation. For example, there is a study<sup id=\"ref_2\">[2](#note_2)</sup>, where CBD injections helped lab rats in reducing pain response to surgical incisions. It is believed, that CBD’s pain relieving effects come from its interactions with the endocannabinoid system(ECS). Another study<sup id=\"ref_3\">[3](#note_3)</sup> in the European Journal of Pain used a topical gel infused with CBD on rats with arthritis for 4 days. Researchers concluded, that there was a large drop in inflammation and pain of rats during the experiment. There are also good news for those who are suffering from chronic pains. Scientists compiled several reports and other researches to conclude that CBD is an effective treatment for this particular issue in adults. On top of that, it is not likely for CBD to build up a tolerance, so it wouldn’t be need to regularly increase a dose of it. \n\n### Anxiety.\n\nAnxiety and depression are pretty typical mental health issues, that might have a very destructive impact on a person. Usually they are being treated with various pharmaceutical drugs, but that kind of long-term treatment can cause numerous side effects<sup id=\"ref_4\">[4](#note_4)</sup> such as insomnia, headaches, erectile dysfunction, etc. National Institute on Drug Abuse stated in their study<sup id=\"ref_5\">[5](#note_5), that CBD was pretty effective in reducing anxiety symptoms in rats behavior. For other forms of anxiety such as social anxiety disorder(SAD) and post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD) CBD was also claimed to be positive in use. A 2011 study’s<sup id=\"ref_6\">[6](#note_6) participants were given either CBD or a placebo and as a result, people who used CBD instead of placebo experienced visible reduce of anxiety. Meanwhile, researches on PTSD concluded that CBD might become a standalone treatment or a supplement to existing medications. So it is likely for CBD to show positive results in treating anxiety issues and its qualities give CBD an opportunity to help people who suffer from various forms of anxiety. Speaking of Depression, it is believed that according to CBD’s positive effect on serotonin level in the brain, it is likely to be helpful in dealing with depression. Although, it isn’t backed by many studies and there’s only couple of them, saying that anti-stress effects of CBD should be handy with treating depression symptoms, so it still needs time to discover full potential of CBD in case of depression.\n\n\n## References\n\n<a name=\"note_1\">1</a>. <sup>[^](http://localhost:3000/admin/#ref_1)</sup> <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19675519>\\\n<a name=\"note_2\">2</a>. <sup>[^](http://localhost:3000/admin/#ref_2)</sup> <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5478794/>\\\n<a name=\"note_3\">3</a>. <sup>[^](http://localhost:3000/admin/#ref_3)</sup> <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4851925/>\\\n<a name=\"note_4\">4</a>. <sup>[^](http://localhost:3000/admin/#ref_4)</sup> <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4970636/>\\\n<a name=\"note_5\">5</a>. <sup>[^](http://localhost:3000/admin/#ref_5)</sup> <https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/legislative-activities/testimony-to-congress/2015/biology-potential-therapeutic-effects-cannabidiol>\\\n<a name=\"note_6\">6</a>. <sup>[^](http://localhost:3000/admin/#ref_6)</sup> <https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0269881110379283>\n<a name=\"note_6\">6</a>. <sup>[^](http://localhost:3000/admin/#ref_7)</sup> <>\n<a name=\"note_6\">6</a>. <sup>[^](http://localhost:3000/admin/#ref_8)</sup> <>\n<a name=\"note_9\">9</a>. <sup>[^](http://localhost:3000/admin/#ref_9)</sup> <>",
