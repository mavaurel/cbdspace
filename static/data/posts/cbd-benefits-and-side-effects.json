  "title": "CBD Benefits and Side Effects",
  "content": "Due to the changes in U.S. hemp-growing law recent years, a new product known as CBD has gained instant popularity among American consumers. Numerous products like tinctures, creams, vape oils and gummy bears infused with CBD are everywhere on the market right now. CBD stands for cannabidiol, an active source in cannabis sativa plant that can easily displace THC by reason of its beneficial properties. The main difference between these two is the fact, that CBD is not mind-altering and can’t cause any psychoactive effect on you, so it looks pretty appealing for those of you who wants to relieve some of their symptoms without the effects of THC. The fact, that CBD can’t get you high is not the only one beneficial thing about it. It interacts with your endocannabinoid system(ECS)<sup id=\"ref_1\">[1](#note_1)</sup>, which is involved in regulation of some functions in your organism, such as pain, appetite, sleep and response of an immune system. Several studies have shown that CBD could be really helpful in treating some medical issues, but is it as advantageous as it is being advertised, let’s learn and find it out!\n\n## How can CBD benefit my health?\n\nInstead of hijacking your endocannabinoid system as THC does, CBD binds to a different receptors, and helps them to work harder in order to make you feel better. Even though there are still not much information about how CBD functions, there are a lot of claims that it may help in treating particular medical issues: ﻿\n\n* Pain and Inflammation\n* Anxiety and Depression     \n* Heart and circulatory system\n* Acne Reduce      \n* Drug addiction and withdrawal\n* Cancer-related problems  \n* Insomnia       \n\nOf course not all of these are supported by researches, because there is a lot much to study about CBD, let’s see what do the facts say about listed benefits.\n\n## Benefits\n\n### Pain and Inflammation\n\nPain and inflammation relief are the most frequent uses of CBD according to the overall statistics. Several studies have found that CBD could be rather effective in case of different types of pain and inflammation. For example, there is a study<sup id=\"ref_2\">[2](#note_2)</sup>, where CBD injections helped lab rats in reducing pain response to surgical incisions. It is believed, that CBD’s pain relieving effects come from its interactions with the endocannabinoid system(ECS). Another study<sup id=\"ref_3\">[3](#note_3)</sup> in the European Journal of Pain used a topical gel infused with CBD on rats with arthritis for 4 days. Researchers concluded, that there was a large drop in inflammation and pain of rats during the experiment. There are also good news for those who are suffering from chronic pains. Scientists compiled several reports and other researches to conclude that CBD is an effective treatment for this particular issue in adults. On top of that, it is not likely for CBD to build up a tolerance, so it wouldn’t be need to regularly increase a dose of it. \n\n### Anxiety\n\nAnxiety and depression are pretty typical mental health issues, that might have a very destructive impact on a person. Usually they are being treated with various pharmaceutical drugs, but that kind of long-term treatment can cause numerous side effects<sup id=\"ref_4\">[4](#note_4)</sup> such as insomnia, headaches, erectile dysfunction, etc. National Institute on Drug Abuse stated in their study<sup id=\"ref_5\">[5](#note_5)</sup>, that CBD was pretty effective in reducing anxiety symptoms in rats behavior. For other forms of anxiety such as social anxiety disorder(SAD) and post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD) CBD was also claimed to be positive in use. A 2011 study’s<sup id=\"ref_6\">[6](#note_6)</sup> participants were given either CBD or a placebo and as a result, people who used CBD instead of placebo experienced visible reduce of anxiety. Meanwhile, researches on PTSD concluded that CBD might become a standalone treatment or a supplement to existing medications. So it is likely for CBD to show positive results in treating anxiety issues and its qualities give CBD an opportunity to help people who suffer from various forms of anxiety. Speaking of Depression, it is believed that according to CBD’s positive effect on serotonin level in the brain, it is likely to be helpful in dealing with depression. Although, it isn’t backed by many studies and there’s only couple of them, saying that anti-stress effects of CBD should be handy with treating depression symptoms, so it still needs time to discover full potential of CBD in case of depression.\n\n### Heart and circulatory system\n\nStudies indicate that CBD might be able to deal with some heart conditions including lower high blood pressure. Some recent studies<sup id=\"ref_7\">[7](#note_7)</sup>  treated healthy men with dose of CBD and as a result it reduced their blood pressure. During all these tests CBD’s properties appeared to be suitable for people with high hypertension levels. Moreover, some other animal study came with a conclusion that stress-reducing properties of CBD may help reduce symptoms associated with heart disease. \n\n### Acne Reduce\n\nAcne is one of the most common skin problems among people. It is caused by various number of reasons, including bacteria, genetics, overproduction of skin secretion, etc. Due to CBD’s anti-inflammatory properties it might be helpful in reducing sebum production, but is there any clues? Yes, it is! Study<sup id=\"ref_8\">[8](#note_8)</sup> claims that CBD prevented sebaceous cells from secreting sebum and induced an anti-inflammatory effect on a skin. It is promising to be one of the most efficient ways in treating acne, but of course before making a firm decision it needs more tests and researches. \n\n### Drug Addiction and Withdrawal\n\nOnce scientists suggested, that CBD could be influential in treating addictions and adverse effects of various substances such as THC, alcohol, opioid addiction, etc. The most famous research on this<sup id=\"ref_9\">[9](#note_9)</sup> showed a case of 19 year old woman who was treated with CBD for ten days to avoid and reduce her cannabis withdrawal syndrome and after that period results were highly positive. Other studies demonstrated that it might also be helpful for people with tobacco and opioid addictions. Researchers observed a total of 24 tobacco smokers who were given half placebo and a half of CBD vape inhalers, and the instruction was to used it when they feel like smoking a cigarette. Over a week participants who were treated with CBD reduced their needs in smoking cigarettes by more than 40 percent comparing to those who were given placebo, and obviously there was no difference before and after the experiment. In other known study researchers recruited 42 people who were using heroin for more than 13 years in a row. After dividing them into three groups, they were given different quantities of CBD, and the third one was treated by a placebo. Results were quite promising, the first two groups experienced straight reduce of their anxiety and craving cause by their drug addiction, comparing to the placebo group. \n\n### Cancer-related symptoms\n\nWhile CBD is being comprehensively researched at the moment, scientists looked at some of its properties, that could be advantageous in treating some cancer-related symptoms like vomiting, nausea and pain. Mostly, before the CBD came at the market, these problems were being treated with THC. One study considered the effectiveness of CBD vs THC in case of cancer issues. Those participants who were given full spectrum CBD with THC experienced a visible pain relief comparing to those who were treated with only THC extract. Most of the modern medication is quite ineffective for cancer and chemotherapy side effects, but CBD appeared to reduce nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. On top of that, many animal studies showed possibility for CBD to even kill cancer cells, but it just slightly worked for lab mice and it is really unlikely for now to cure cancer with it, though there is more to explore about these properties of CBD. \n\n### Insomnia\n\nSuch thing like insomnia and bad sleep habits can be caused by various factors. Everything from your mental health issues to some physical conditions could disturb your sleep cycle. There’s still no firm answer to question how CBD helps to sleep well, but this surprisingly works. Most of the researches are focused on insomnia caused by different things like pain, anxiety and sleep cycle problems. To the moment it all looks very promising, because insomnia is a wide-range problem of a modern society, and possibility of having safe treatment for it is really hopeful. As for now, if you have some sleep problems, you may try CBD, but be aware that the effect is not immediate and take time to feel your body rhythms.\n\n*In summary, all of the listed benefits are good-looking, but in need of more studies and researches to be straight and firm, now there’s another question - are there any side effects that would possibly outweigh all these benefits? Let’s see for yourself!*\n\n## Side effects\n\nBasically, to the moment there’s no particular reason to consider CBD as an unsafe product, but there are some reactions that were caused in people by CBD:   \n\n* fatigue     \n* drowsiness  \n* several mood changes  \n* liver damage  \n* diarrhea     \n  \nSounds like, nothing critical, right? Even though there is nothing crazy to be afraid of, CBD may interact with your daily medication and it is highly recommended visiting and consult with your pharmacist, because CBD is not that largely studied and it is still a chance of being affected by it. Speaking of market, you should be aware of bad people on it who just want your money, but your health and wellness is your concern, so check twice before buying something. \n\n## Bottom line\n\nOn that point, we must conclude, that CBD could be rather beneficial in particular issues, but not in all cases. The biggest problem of it for now is lack of researches and it is only a matter of time until CBD will be totally safe. As for now, we hope that you find all this information useful, it is very important for us. Stay tuned for more articles and information.",
