  "content": "Nowadays, CBD is on its peak of popularity. It is recognizable almost everywhere across the United States, due to its high therapeutic properties and accessibility. The diversity of products available for consumers is even more interesting - you can buy everything starting with  CBD oils, drops, vape liquids, ending with various creams and edibles of all kinds. \n\nThe overall craze around CBD is usually associated with [2018 farm bill](/2018-farm-bill-and-what-it-means-for-cbd-industry/), that allowed to produce and sell hemp products on the territory of the United States(but only for licensed growers, and if the amount of THC in their plants does not exceed 0.3%). Meantime, the overall trend on CBD only increased, and there are some straight reasons for that. \n\nFirst of all, the therapeutic potential of CBD is quite promising, on top of that, the opportunity to become the most popular natural supplement, or even a standalone treatment for certain health issues, becomes real day by day. Tons of scientists and researchers across the globe are working on discovering the full potential of CBD in order to help us. \n\nThe second main reason CBD is famous for, is the diversity and accessibility of products. Not only the stalls of your favorite shops are flooded with these, but even specific CDB stores were opened for consumers. However, not all of us have decent information or news, and we’re being frequently asked about this or that stuff connected with CBD. One of the most frequent questions is about the safety of CBD - “is CBD dangerous, or even cause damage to my body?”  \n\nAfter reading plenty of these, we found the question that was most common among them - what about CBD and drug interactions? Can it cause any trouble, if I’m using CBD with my daily medication, or maybe alcohol? This is a pretty important question, that’s why we are here to speak of it. However, not so long before, we need to understand the basics of how CBD and other medicine behaves in our bodies. First of all, what is CBD and how it works?\n\n## Basics: What is CBD and how does it work?\n\nFirst of all, CBD medical abbreviation stands short for cannabidiol and represents one of the primary compounds found in \\[Tooltip]cannabis plant\\[Tooltip]. As for his nearest cousins, you have probably heard of THC, the primary psychoactive compound of cannabis. Unlike THC, CBD can’t get you to the “high” state no matter how much and how long you use, because it just works differently. CBD is usually being extracted from the hemp plant, which is only legal in the U.S. if the amount of THC in it not higher than 0,3%, so, officially, it cannot get you to the altered state in any ways. \n\nIt can be consumed in various [forms](/how-do-i-take-cbd/). For example, you can consume CBD infused edibles or pills, drop special oils under your tongue, rub infused creams and lotions into your skin, or inhale special CBD infused liquids with your vape pen. Before heading to our main subject, we should determine in the next paragraph, what does CBD do to your body and how it interacts with your health?\n\nEvery one of us has its own endocannabinoid system(ECS), which is a complex of receptors giving signals to our body and produces cannabinoids to maintain \\[Tooltip]homeostasis\\[Tooltip] and our overall wellness. The ECS is responsible for regulation of many functions in our body: immunity, mood, memory, appetite, etc. For example, the thing known as “runner’s high” is a result of working ECS. \n\nEndocannabinoid system has receptors, that either CBD or THC interact with, CB1 and CB2. Unlike THC, CBD due to its shape doesn’t try to replace our natural \\[Tooltip]neurotransmitters\\[Tooltip] called anandamide, but just binds to these receptors producing much more cannabinoids to maintain our natural body rhythms. \n\nThe exact ways of how CB1 and CB2 receptors affect on our brains isn’t fully understood so there are still more to study and research. Fortunately, we know more about how other drugs behave and function in our body. So, what is CYP450 and how drug metabolism works?\n\n## How drug metabolism works and what is CYP450?\n\nAs happens with all substances in our body, it has either to break or metabolize it. Metabolism passes throughout our body, as in the guts, but the liver is also important in that process. There is a family of \\[Tooltip]enzymes\\[Tooltip] called cytochrome P450(or CYP450), which is responsible for reorganizing all foreign substance into something, that our body will easily eliminate. \n\nHowever, there exist other substances or drugs, that can affect CYP450 by speeding up or slowing our natural drug metabolism, that’s why it is important. Simply put, if you consume things, that interact themselves, it may cause serious trouble, like altering the effects or process of your other medication. \n\nThe other important thing is, that CYP450 enzymes are important for metabolizing cannabinoids, like CBD. There are also important enzyme called CYP3A4, that also participates in metabolizing CBD and almost 60% of other prescription medication. It all means, that either slowing down or speeding up the process of metabolism can cause serious issues. \n\nFor example, if your drug metabolism works quicker than it needs, the dose of medicine you consume daily could become less effective. Meanwhile, if your metabolism is too slow, your normal dose could become too much, overloading your body. It sounds scary, but you shouldn’t be, if you are making decisions following your doctor’s instructions. \n\nFor example, you want to try CBD to treat [anxiety and depression](/does-cbd-work-for-anxiety/), and this is definitely not the type of issue you can treat by yourself. However, you may be still interested in the potential drug interactions with CBD, let’s figure it out in next paragraph. \n\n## What are the potential drug interactions of CBD?\n\nThere are many studies both on animals and humans, trying to see what are the most dangerous drug interactions in case of CBD. Most of these researches don’t have any firm conclusion on what is good or bad, because it is hard to convert human and animal test, but we may say straighly, that CBD will definitely mess up with medication levels in your body, no matter you use prescribed dosage or not. \n\nThat is why it is hard to calculate whether it is bad to use CBD in certain situations, because the results of lab tests aren’t straightforward. Fortunately, even in this kind of situation, there exists a thumb rule confirmed by Food and Drug Administration(FDA), that will help you to avoid some possible drug interactions: the so called “grapefruit warning”.  Simply put, if your prescribed medication has this warning on the label, you should probably avoid consuming CBD. It is called that way, because grapefruit chemicals affect CYP3A4 in pretty the same way CBD does and can easily increase concentration of medication you use. \n\nThere are more than 80 drugs that have grapefruit warning, and you may read the scientific material on it here<sup id=\"ref_1\">[1](#note_1)</sup>\n\nSpeaking personally, it would be better just visiting your doctor and discuss all the aspects with him\\her, but it would be also nice if you had some information about certain products or brands, because not all the doctors are familiar with this diversity of CBD products, and specifically if you want to use particular product or form of CBD, for example CBD lollipops or gum, that is why we created a personal tip list, which will ease your shopping and help you with looking on a certain thing while purchasing.\n\n## How to properly shop for CBD and what to look for?\n\nWhen it comes to choosing products, you must always be wise and careful, because the mistakes may cost you health. Here we want to give you some personal advice to your CBD market discovery:\n\n* ***Legality status:*** First of all, check state and federal laws of your area. Even if you know, that CBD is safe and legal, your area’s laws can still prohibit growing or using CBD. Fortunately, on the territory of the United States it is almost legal, but check this information just to be verified, it should be very easy to access.\n* ***Certification:*** Any CBD product should be approved by a document known as COA, it shows that lab tested and checked for the \\[Tooltip]potency\\[Tooltip]. Moreover, the batch number of COA should match the one on the label. All this information on the product should be easily found according to the local and state laws, it should make your choice more verified on a certain product.\n* ***Testing:*** Any tests on a CBD products must meet with\"ISO 17025\"standards and also be validated with one of the official regulatory organizations:U.S. Pharmacopeia, Association of Official Agricultural Chemists, or the American Herbal Pharmacopoeia.\n* ***Where the hemp comes from?:*** You should always check, that the hemp was produced by a licensed grower on the territory of the United States and fits all the agriculture laws, that will totally help you find the right product that might fulfill all your demands.\n\nThis is not a complete list, but some useful tips for you.
