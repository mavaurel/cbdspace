  "content": "The industry of hemp is growing now as one of the quickest and most popular natural sector industries around the globe. These days law around hemp derived products is changing, and they become much more accessible. After the [2018 farm bill](/2018-farm-bill-and-what-it-means-for-cbd-industry/), that allowed producing and selling hemp on the territory of the United States(but only for licensed growers and if the amount of THC in the plant does not exceed 0.3%), CBD products almost instantly flooded the stalls of your favorite stores, and even specific CBD stores were opened.\n\nThe diversity of products available for consumers is even more interesting - everything from creams, lotions, vape liquids, to different edibles and special sublingual tinctures. Furthermore, not only products are different, but the labels itself - some say full-spectrum CBD, some say CBD isolate.\n\nAfter that, the overall trend on CBD has only increased, and there are serious reasons for that. The first one is incredible therapeutic potential and possibility to treat certain issues like depression, [anxiety](/does-cbd-work-for-anxiety/), skin problems, PTSD, heart-related problems, some forms of pain and much more. Tons of researches and lab tests are being made to discover CBD full potential, and it is only a matter of time till we see all the benefits and overall effectiveness.\n\nThe second main reason is the abundance of products available and the fact that they’re pretty easy to access and use.The possibility of CBD to become a serious supplement to your daily medication or even a standalone treatment is kind of promising. As we said, tons of different products already spreaded across the market, and the choice between them may become a kind of pain. \n\nAs for today, we are going to talk about particular form of CBD - full spectrum CBD. What is it? How is it made? How is it used? We are going to answer these questions pretty soon, but before we should determine all the basic information connected with CBD in general. So, what is CBD and how it works?\n\n## Basics: What is CBD and how does it work?\n\nFirst of all, CBD abbreviation stands short for cannabidiol and represents one of the primary compounds found in cannabis plant. As for his nearest cousins, you have probably heard of THC, the primary psychoactive compound of cannabis. Unlike THC, CBD can’t get you to the “high” state no matter how much and how long you use, because it just works differently. CBD is usually being extracted from the hemp plant, which is only one legal strain of hemp in the U.S. if the amount of THC in it not higher than 0,3%, so, officially, it cannot get you to the altered state in any ways.\n\nIt can be consumed in various [forms](/how-do-i-take-cbd/). For example, you may inhale it by vaping CBD infused liquids, or eat infused edibles like gummy bears or pills, or even take it topically with creams and lotions, but the most popular method across users is taking it sublingually, getting special tinctures under your tongue. It is clear, you may choose any of it depending on your demands and reasons, but how does it work in general?\n\nEvery one of us has its own endocannabinoid system(ECS), which is a complex of receptors giving signals to our body and produces cannabinoids to support \\[Tooltip]homeostasis\\[Tooltip] and our overall wellness. The ECS is responsible for regulation of many functions in our body: immunity, mood, memory, appetite, etc. For example, the thing known as “runner’s high” is a result of working ECS.\n\nEndocannabinoid system has receptors, that either CBD or THC interact with, CB1 and CB2. Unlike THC, CBD due to its shape doesn’t try to replace our natural \\[Tooltip]neurotransmitters\\[Tooltip] called anandamide, but just binds to these receptors producing much more cannabinoids to maintain our natural body rhythms. The exact ways of how CB1 and CB2 receptors affect on our brains isn’t fully understood so there are still more to study and research. According to studies, CBD is claimed to be absolutely safe in its pure state and today we are going to talk about wholesome form of CBD oil called full spectrum. Anyway, what is full spectrum CBD?\\\n\n## What is full spectrum CBD?\n\nThe term “full spectrum” is used to describe an extract, containing full range of existing cannabinoids of cannabis plant. For those of you, who are not familiar with CBD or other cannabinoids, it may look strange, but excluding CBD and THC there are more than a hundred different cannabinoids that cannabis plant consists of.\n\nFurthermore, full spectrum products do not only consist of just cannabinoids. Alongside with CBD, THC, CBG, CBN and other cannabinoids come terpenes, flavonoids and other natural materials. Full spectrum products may be purchased as other CBD products available like pills, e-juices, ointments, etc.\n\nHowever, we know that on the territory of the United States it is only legal to produce hemp, that contains up to 0.3% of THC in it. It means, that all these full spectrum products are being usually extracted from low THC hemp plants, not the marijuana ones. It won’t make you high, because the amount of THC in this kind of products is quite small.\n\nTherefore, you might have some questions about the purpose of using full spectrum products, and here comes the term known as the “entourage effect”. So, why should I use full spectrum product instead of my CBD isolates?\n\n## What is the “Entourage Effect”?\n\nSpeaking science, the entourage effect is a chemical reaction, that activates when a mix of cannabinoids gets into your body at the same time, increasing all their effects simultaneously. Broadly speaking, this synergy makes full spectrum products more powerful, depending on the thing you want to achieve with it.\n\nSome time ago people thought that this effect is just a myth, but to the moment we may actually say this is truth and it might be rather beneficial than isolated form of CBD. We guess, that it is the main advantage of using full spectrum products against other options. It means that you shouldn’t exclude this type of products from your choice, only because of the fact, that it contains THC.\n\nLook at it from the other angle - cannabis plant contains much more useful materials, than CBD itself, and not only cannabinoids, but terpenes and flavonoids as well, that might be helpful with treating certain health issues and maintain your overall wellness. It is only the starting information about it, but [here](/whole-plant-insight-what-is-the-entourage-effect/) you can see more.\n\nAlthough, what are the actual benefits of using full spectrum products? What this kind of CBD oil good for?\n\n## Benefits of using whole plant extract.(Full Spectrum CBD)\n\nAccording to some studies, full spectrum products were rather more effective that isolated CBDonly. While not all uses of full spectrum products backed up with strict science, there are some promising researches, claiming its effectiveness in treating some issues.\n\nFor example, scientists found whole plant extracts effective in relieving pain and inflammation from gastrointestinal disorders. More than that, it was pretty competent in helping with \\[Tooltip]seizures\\[Tooltip] from neurological disorders, especially those patients, suffering from neurological conditions, that are usual treatment-resistant. Simply put, it helped with some epilepsy cases, and the Food and Drug Administration of the United States already approved a prescription drug called Epidiolex, that is designed to help with this kind of issues.\n\nMoreover, there are plenty of long case studies, claiming full spectrum products as a good anxiety relieving options. Most of the people participated in these tests reported to have minimal side effects, improved sleep patterns, and what’s more - reduced heavy symptoms of chronic anxiety.\n\nHowever, alongside with advantages come some risks, and not the usual ones. While there are little side effects, which are mostly individual and temporary like diarrhea, low blood pressure, dizziness and dry mouth, there comes things that are much more scary - untrusted brands and fake products.\n\nThe overall market is still not regulated much, because the organizations responsible for it are mostly busy testing the potential of CBD.
