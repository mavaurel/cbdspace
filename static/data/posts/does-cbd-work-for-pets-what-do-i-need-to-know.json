  "content": "# Does CBD work for pets? What do I need to know?\n\nWhy do we hear about CBD oil so much at the moment? Statistics show, that it is connected with the legalization of hemp growing and other cannabis plants across the United States and other places. As for U.S. there is a 2018 farm bill, that allowed producing and selling hemp, but only for a licensed growers and if the amount of THC in the plant does not exceed 0.3%. Later, the overall trend on the CBD and other products escalated in a stunning speed. Nowadays, it is not surprising to see tons of CBD products starting with oils, tinctures and ending with various edibles and even vape liquids, in your common stores. The second main reason CBD became mainstream is high therapeutic potential and possibility of growing into a strong natural supplement or even a standalone treatment for certain issues. However, the full potential is still being discovered and studied by thousands of scientists and researchers and it is only a matter of time till we see all the benefits of CBD. It is possible, that you don’t look CBD for yourself for some reasons, but what about your pets? Is there any evidence, that CBD might be a good treatment or supplement for my cat or dog? We know that you are concerned about your pet’s wellness and that’s why the subject of our discussion today is “Does CBD work for pets and what do you need to know about it?” Let’s figure it out starting with commons connected with CBD in general!\\\n\n## Basics: What is CBD and how does it work?\n\nFirst of all, CBD abbreviation stands short for cannabidiol and represents one of the primary compounds found in cannabis plant. As for his nearest cousins, you have probably heard of THC, the primary psychoactive compound of cannabis. Unlike THC, CBD can’t get you to the “high” state no matter how much and how long you use, because it just works differently. CBD is usually being extracted from the hemp plant, which is only legal in the U.S. if the amount of THC in it not higher than 0,3%, so, officially, it cannot get you to the altered state in any ways. It can be consumed in various forms. For example, you may inhale it by vaping CBD infused liquids, or eat infused edibles like gummy bears or pills, or even take it topically with creams and lotions, but the most popular method across users is taking it sublingually, getting special tinctures under your tongue. It is clear, you may choose any of it depending on your demands and reasons, but how does it work in general?\n\nEvery one of us has its own endocannabinoid system(ECS), which is a complex of receptors giving signals to our body and produces cannabinoids to maintain homeostasis and our overall wellness. The ECS is responsible for regulation of many functions in our body: immunity, mood, memory, appetite, etc. For example, the thing known as “runner’s high” is a result of working ECS. Endocannabinoid system has receptors, that either CBD or THC interact with, CB1 and CB2. Unlike THC, CBD due to its shape doesn’t try to replace our natural hormones called anandamide, but just binds to these receptors producing much more cannabinoids to maintain our natural body rhythms. The exact ways of how CB1 and CB2 receptors affect on our brains isn’t fully understood so there are still more to study and research. So, is there any evidence, that CBD may help your dog or cat?\n\n## Is there any evidence that CBD works for your dogs and cats?\n\nTo the moment, there are no strict studies subjecting CBD as treatment for your domestic pets. However, most CBD studies had rats as their primary subjects, and the results were quite promising. Not only humans have endocannabinoid system, but the rats, cats, dogs, and others as well. Therefore, we know how CBD interacts with the ECS and may assume, in what way CBD may benefit your pet’s wellness and health.\n\n## What are the potential benefits of CBD for your pet?\n\nWhile there is no strict science on treating your pet with CBD, we may only suggest and support our thoughts with some researches and consumer’s reviews. According to some data, it is possible for CBD to treat pain, especially neuropathic and some pet owners report it may as well help control seizures. It is all being suggested only because of CBD high therapeutic properties and possibility of helping with pets inflammation, heart-related problems, appetite switches, anxiety and cancer, but that’s only a suggestion, because as we have mentioned before, there is no convincing and complete scientific data on it. Fortunately, due to this potential, the researches and tests are being increasingly sponsored and we hope that in a short period we are going to add some new information on it. Additionally, even if we know that CBD is totally safe, we should break down some side effects and risks if you want to try it on your pets.\n\n## Any side effects, or risks for my pet?\n\nAs we have said before, there is no specific science on how CBD affects your pets, we know how it interacts with a human body. There are no critical side effects, however there are some temporary issues:\n\n* Drowsiness: if we talk about cats and dogs, it means that CBD can calm down dogs too much and cause drowsiness at some point.\n* Dry mouth: in case of pets, CBD can cause increased thirst and decrease the amount of saliva.\n* Low blood pressure: CBD can cause a drop in a blood pressure. Even if the drop is not big, it may lead to some issues without a proper attitude.\n\nAnd that’s only what we know at the moment and may submit. As for risks, there are no special warnings from the Food and Drug Administration of the United States, which is responsible for CBD regulation and dosage charts that are recommended for your dogs, cats, and others. So, we don’t know how much CBD is either good or bad for pets and recommend you visiting veterinarian before trying CBD on your beloved pet. Simply put, any new medication can cause some risks because of the individuality of any species. Be accurate with your pets health, even if you are well-intentioned. If you are already aware that CBD might be a good choice for your small friends, we are going to share some shopping tips, because the market is still quite unregulated and it is favorable to be wise while buying anything.\n\n## How to shop for your dog’s CBD oil?\n\nIf your veterinarian agreed to treat your pet with some CBD, there are still some things to keep in mind. Your pet’s body needs much more precision, because they are not as tolerant to chemicals as we are. Not all the products on the market are the same in the means of quality and even legality. The federal law on CBD is strict for now, so, you should follow some simple tips while purchasing anything, because vet clinics may also be not as familiar with CBD and it’s up to you to choose what’s best treat for your dog, for example. Here are the tips:\n\n* ***Certification:*** any CBD product should be approved by a document known as COA, it shows that lab tested and checked for the potency(the confirmed amount of CBD and THC in the product that listed on the label). Moreover, the batch number of COA should match the one on the label. All this information on the product should be easily found according to the local and state laws, it should make your choice more verified on a certain product.\n* ***Testing:*** Any tests on a CBD products must meet with\"ISO 17025\"standards and also be validated with one of the official regulatory organizations:U.S. Pharmacopeia, Association of Official Agricultural Chemists, or the American Herbal Pharmacopoeia.\n* ***Where the hemp comes from?:*** You should always check, that the hemp was produced by a licensed grower on the territory of the United States and fits all the agriculture laws, that will totally help you find the right product that might fulfill all your demands.\n\nBasically, always chase for the highest quality, because it is still a mystery, how CBD may affect your pet. So, it is recommended monitoring everything and record how much you treat your dog or cat in order to figure out the optimal dosage and quality.\n\n## Bottom line.\n\nAs for now, it is quite promising industry, but there are still a lot of blank areas.
