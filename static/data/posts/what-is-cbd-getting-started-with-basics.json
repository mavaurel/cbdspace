  "content": "Today’s explosive popularity of CBD is a known fact, especially in the areas where its legal. You might already have seen numerous products, such as tinctures, oils, creams, edibles etc. Due to the fact that the presence of CBD on the market escalated pretty quickly, many of you still have several questions about it. Basically, this article is directed to make things clear about CBD for all of you.  \n\n## All in all, what is CBD?\n\nCBD stands short for cannabidiol, a chemical compound from cannabis sativa plant, also known as marijuana or hemp. Probably you’ve heard of its cousin, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, which is the major active source in marijuana. The main difference between these two is the fact, that CBD is not psychoactive at all, which gives it a large amount of therapeutic opportunities.  \n\n## The origin is clear, but how does it work?\n\nEvery human being has its own endocannabinoid system, the one that creates cannabinoids in our bodies. Speaking simply, our every particular sense of well-being and mood elevation is a hard work of endocannabinoid system to maintain homeostasis, our biological balance in body’s natural rhythms. Cannabinoids like CBD interact with that system at two receptors - CB1 and CB2. CB1 receptors are mostly presented in the brain and responsible for cognition, motor skills, memory, nervous system and much more. On the other hand, CB2 receptors exist essentially in gastrointestinal and immune systems of human body. Comparing to the effect of THC, CBD doesn’t really hijack your endocannabinoid system, but only binds to its receptors in order to help your body produce more cannabinoids and make you feel relaxed without getting high and other psychoactive side effects.\n\n## Alright, I’m interested, but how can it help me?\n\nSince the CBD came to the market, its being advertised as a cure-all treatment, but we are here to share with you real CBD effectiveness. According to modern researches, it is indicated, that CBD may help you with:\n\n* Various kinds of pain(chronic, neuropathic, etc)\n* Epilepsy(<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604191/>)\n* Inflammation(<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2828614/>)\n* Anxiety(<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604171/>)\n* ADHD(<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28576350>)\n* Depression(<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923339>) \n* Schizophrenia(<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4604190/>)\n* Parkinson’s(<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5436333/>)\n* Substance Abuse\\Withdrawal(<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4444130/>)\n\nThese are only few examples of real CBD influence on different kinds of diseases.\n\n## Okay, it might be good for me, but is it safe overall?\n\nAccording to a World Health Organisation report(<https://www.who.int/medicines/access/controlled-substances/5.2_CBD.pdf>),it is believed, that CBD in its pure state is safe and it seems improbable to cause any physical dependence or abuse. However, you should be aware of some side effects and risks of using CBD. Generally speaking, the major side effects that connected to CBD are low blood pressure, dry mouth, drowsiness and lightheadedness in some way. The second thing is, that quality of products you may buy is not being controlled on federal way, so you should be wise purchasing CBD in recreational or medical purposes.  \n\n## Now I’m informed and decide to start using CBD, but there are so many methods, which should I choose?\n\nFirst things first, you should decide why are you using CBD and what do you want to reach with it. Basically, we can differ all these methods by the speed of delivery and how long the effect lasts. For example, vaping is the fastest way to deliver CBD into your body, somewhere about 10 minutes, but the effect is gonna be less extensive in time comparing to the other ways. Tinctures and edibles like gummies or pills are the most effective in time and last for about 4 or 5 hours. There are also topicals, such as creams or ointments for local pain reliefs. It is only for you to decide which method would fit your demands, and fortunately the market of CBD products is quite wide at the moment. \n\n## Conclusion. \n\nIn this article we decided to focus on all the basics in order to help you choose your own way in this whole new world of CBD. It’s up to you whether or not using it, but we tried to gather all the useful information you may begin with. We hope that you will find our “starting guide” handy.
