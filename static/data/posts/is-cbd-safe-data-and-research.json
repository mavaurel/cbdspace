  "content": "Nowadays, CBD is on its peak of popularity. It is recognizable almost everywhere across the United States, due to its high therapeutic properties and accessibility. The diversity of products available for consumers is even more interesting - you can buy everything starting with CBD oils, concentrates, vape liquids, ending with various creams and edibles of all kinds.\n\nThe overall craze around CBD is usually associated with [2018 farm bill](https://cbdspace.io/2018-farm-bill-and-what-it-means-for-cbd-industry/), that allowed to produce and sell hemp products on the territory of the United States(but only for licensed growers, and if the amount of THC in their plants does not exceed 0.3%). Meantime, the overall trend on CBD only increased, and there are some straight reasons for that.\n\nFirst of all, the therapeutic potential of CBD is quite promising, on top of that, the opportunity to become the most popular natural supplement, or even a standalone treatment for certain health issues, becomes real day by day. Tons of scientists and researchers across the globe are working on discovering the full potential of CBD in order to help us.\n\nThe second main reason CBD is famous for, is the diversity and accessibility of products. Not only the stalls of your favorite shops are flooded with these, but even specific CDB stores were opened for consumers. However, not all of us have decent information or news, and we’re being frequently asked about this or that stuff connected with CBD.\n\nOne of the most frequent questions is about the safety of CBD - “is CBD dangerous, or even cause some damage to my body?” Reading plenty of these, we decided to observe this topic as one of the most important, because many of you still aren’t sure about the overall CBD safety. Before that, we should determine all the commons connected with CBD and its work to answer this question properly. So, what is CBD and how it works?\n\n#### Basics: What is CBD and how it works?\n\nFirst of all, CBD abbreviation stands short for cannabidiol and represents one of the primary compounds found in cannabis plant. As for his nearest cousins, you have probably heard of THC, the primary psychoactive compound of cannabis. Unlike THC, CBD can’t get you to the “high” state no matter how much and how long you use, because it just works differently.\n\nCBD is usually being extracted from the hemp plant, which is only legal in the U.S. if the amount of THC in it not higher than 0,3%, so, officially, it cannot get you to the altered state in any ways. It can be consumed in various forms.\n\nFor example, you can consume CBD infused edibles or pills, drop special oils under your tongue, rub infused creams and lotions into your skin, or inhale special CBD infused liquids with your vape pen. Before heading to our main subject, we should determine in the next paragraph, what does CBD do to your body and how it interacts with your health?\n\nEvery one of us has its own endocannabinoid system(ECS), which is a complex of receptors giving signals to our body and produces cannabinoids to maintain homeostasis and our overall wellness. The ECS is responsible for regulation of many functions in our body: immunity, mood, memory, appetite, etc. For example, the thing known as “runner’s high” is a result of working ECS.\n\nEndocannabinoid system has receptors, that either CBD or THC interact with, CB1 and CB2. Unlike THC, CBD due to its shape doesn’t try to replace our natural hormones called anandamide, but just binds to these receptors producing much more cannabinoids to maintain our natural body rhythms. The exact ways of how CB1 and CB2 receptors affect on our brains isn’t fully understood so there are still more to study and research. Even though we understand now how CBD affects our organism, but how can it benefit your health particularly, what is CBD oil used for?\n\n### What are the uses and benefits of CBD?\n\nAs for now, it is clear, that CBD is being continuously researched and discussed on a lot. Most researches claim, that CBD products should be helpful with treating certain health issues, like anxiety, inflammation, severe forms of pain, acne, drug addiction, insomnia, heart-related issues and [much more](https://cbdspace.io/what-are-the-uses-of-cbd-will-it-work-for-me/).\n\nUnfortunately, not all the uses and benefits are backed up by trusted resources, but it is not time to be sad. We tried to analyze most of the cases that CBD might be helpful with. 100% sure, that these facts are going to help us answer the main question about CBD safety. Here are some studies and facts we found via exploring some credible sources:\n\n***Pain and Inflammation.***\n\nPain and inflammation relief are the most frequent uses of CBD according to the overall statistics. Several studies have found that CBD could be rather effective in case of different types of pain and inflammation.\n\nFor example, there is a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5478794/), where CBD injections helped lab rats in reducing pain response to surgical incisions. It is believed, that CBD’s pain relieving effects come from its interactions with the endocannabinoid system(ECS).\n\nAnother [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4851925/) in the European Journal of Pain used a topical gel infused with CBD on rats with arthritis for 4 days. Researchers concluded, that there was a large drop in inflammation and pain of rats during the experiment.\n\nThere are also good news for those who are suffering from chronic pains. Scientists compiled several reports and other researches to conclude that CBD is an effective treatment for this particular issue in adults. Even more material can be found [here](https://cbdspace.io/does-cbd-help-with-pain/).\n\nOn top of that, it is not likely for CBD to build up a tolerance, so it wouldn’t be need to regularly increase a dose of it.\n\n***Anxiety.***\n\nAnxiety and depression are pretty typical mental health issues, that might have a very destructive impact on a person. Usually they are being treated with various pharmaceutical drugs, but that kind of long-term treatment can cause numerous [side effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4970636/) such as insomnia, headaches, erectile dysfunction, etc.\n\nNational Institute on Drug Abuse stated in their [study](https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/legislative-activities/testimony-to-congress/2015/biology-potential-therapeutic-effects-cannabidiol), that CBD was pretty effective in reducing anxiety symptoms in rats behavior. For other forms of anxiety such as social anxiety disorder(SAD) and post-traumatic stress disorder(PTSD) CBD was also claimed to be positive in use.\n\nA 2011 [study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0269881110379283)’s participants were given either CBD or a placebo and as a result, people who used CBD instead of placebo experienced visible reduce of anxiety. Meanwhile, researches on PTSD concluded that CBD might become a standalone treatment or a supplement to existing medications.\n\nSo it is likely for CBD to show positive results in treating anxiety issues and its qualities give CBD an opportunity to help people who suffer from various forms of anxiety.\n\nSpeaking of Depression, it is believed that according to CBD’s positive effect on serotonin level in the brain, it is likely to be helpful in dealing with depression. Although, it isn’t backed by many studies and there’s only couple of them, saying that anti-stress effects of CBD should be handy with treating depression symptoms, so it still needs time to discover full potential of CBD in case of depression.

During all these tests CBD’s properties appeared to be suitable for people with high hypertension levels.\n\nMoreover, some other animal study came with a conclusion that stress-reducing properties of CBD may help reduce symptoms associated with heart disease.\n\n***Acne Reduce.***\n\nAcne is one of the most common skin problems among people. It is caused by various number of reasons, including bacteria, genetics, overproduction of skin secretion, etc. Due to CBD’s anti-inflammatory properties it might be helpful in reducing sebum production, but is there any clues? Yes, it is!\n\n[Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25061872) claims that CBD prevented sebaceous cells from secreting sebum and induced an anti-inflammatory effect on a skin. It is promising to be one of the most efficient ways in treating acne, but of course before making a firm decision it needs more tests and researches.\n\n***Drug Addiction and Withdrawal.***\n\nOnce scientists suggested, that CBD could be influential in treating addictions and adverse effects of various substances such as THC, alcohol, opioid addiction, etc. The most famous [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23095052) on this showed a case of 19 year old woman who was treated with CBD for ten days to avoid and reduce her cannabis withdrawal syndrome and after that period results were highly positive.\n\nOther studies demonstrated that it might also be helpful for people with tobacco and opioid addictions. Researchers observed a total of 24 tobacco smokers who were given half placebo and a half of CBD vape inhalers, and the instruction was to used it when they feel like smoking a cigarette. Over a week participants who were treated with CBD reduced their needs in smoking cigarettes by more than 40 percent comparing to those who were given placebo, and obviously there was no difference before and after the experiment.\n\nIn other known study researchers recruited 42 people who were using heroin for more than 13 years in a row. After dividing them into three groups, they were given different quantities of CBD, and the third one was treated by a placebo. Results were quite promising, the first two groups experienced straight reduce of their anxiety and craving cause by their drug addiction, comparing to the placebo group.\n\n***Cancer-related symptoms.***\n\nWhile CBD is being comprehensively researched at the moment, scientists looked at some of its properties, that could be advantageous in treating some cancer-related symptoms like vomiting, nausea and pain. Mostly, before the CBD came at the market, these problems were being treated with THC.\n\nOne study considered the effectiveness of [CBD vs THC](https://cbdspace.io/cbd-vs-thc-is-cbd-better/) in case of cancer issues. Those participants who were given full spectrum CBD with THC experienced a visible pain relief comparing to those who were treated with only THC extract.\n\nMost of the modern medication is quite ineffective for cancer and chemotherapy side effects, but CBD appeared to reduce nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. On top of that, many animal studies showed possibility for CBD to even kill cancer cells, but it just slightly worked for lab mice and it is really unlikely for now to cure cancer with it, though there is more to explore about these properties of CBD.\n\n***Insomnia***\n\nSuch thing like insomnia and bad sleep habits can be caused by various factors. Everything from your mental health issues to some physical conditions could disturb your sleep cycle. There’s still no firm answer to question how CBD helps to sleep well, but this surprisingly works.\n\nMost of the researches are focused on insomnia caused by different things like pain, anxiety and sleep cycle problems. To the moment it all looks very promising, because insomnia is a wide-range problem of a modern society, and possibility of having safe treatment for it is really hopeful. As for now, if you have some sleep problems, you may try CBD, but be aware that the effect is not immediate and take time to feel your body rhythms.\n\nThe list isn’t full to the moment, because studies are still going on, and this particular material is presented to show you the overall thoughts and facts on CBD effectiveness. As for now, it is time to answer our main question - is CBD safe after all?\n\n## Do we have any evidence, that CBD is safe?\n\nWhile there are a lot of untrusted information floating around the internet, there are still some firm verdicts on CBD and its safety. For example, World Health Organization did a review on a CBD and we may highlight some important statements.\n\nCBD doesn’t cause any abuse or dependence in humans, according to the researches and clinical trials. It is well tolerated and represents safe profile, and the majority of negative experience is associated with other [drug to drug interactions](https://cbdspace.io/cbd-and-drug-interactions-is-it-dangerous/) between CBD and other medication.\n\nFurthermore, there is no evidence that pure CBD causes any health problems either in recreational or medical use. Additionally, FDA(Food and Drug Administration) approved CBD based treatment for epilepsy known as Epidiolex, and that verifies overall safety of product itself.\n\nHowever, you should be concerned about several important notes. CBD is quite new product and the market still isn’t regulated as much as it should be. It means, that even if the rules on producing and selling CBD are strict, there are many unsafe, even dangerous products and brands, that you should keep out from.\n\nImagine that only one organization like FDA makes decisions over CBD and must control the products and accompanying equipment. It needs much more time to calm the craze down and make all the tested needed to start controlling that mess.\n\nSimply put, you should be aware of untrusted brands and products. Additionally, we should observe some temporary side effects and dangerous interactions that CBD may cause in the next paragraph in order to make a final verdict.\n\n### Potential risks and side effects of CBD.\n\nIf we exclude risks from untrusted brands and using fake products, we still have something to say about qualified CBD products. Even if CBD is completely safe, it may interact with your daily medication and sometimes cause some temporary side effects like diarrhea, dizziness, dry mouth and lower your blood pressure. It is not crucial and mostly and individual issue, however the drug to drug interactions are much more of a problem without a proper attention.\n\nWe personally recommend all of you, who want to try CBD for yourself visiting doctor or pharmacist first. There are no best options in choosing CBD, all the dosings and other settings are pretty individual and only specialist can say for sure, if the CBD is going to be a safe choice for you and your body.\n\n#### Bottom line.\n\nAs for now, we may conclude, that CBD in its pure form is completely safe for you and isn’t likely to cause any damage. However, it is necessary to visit your pharmacist first before making any decisions. Don’t let other people make decisions for you.
