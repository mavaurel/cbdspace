  "content": "CBD has come a long way since it first came to the market, and it means that methods of extractions changed as well. Earlier, the extraction techniques of cannabis were as simple as possible, but now it has nothing to do with it. Nowadays, the extraction became something like art. \n\nOne of the newest production methods of CBD is distillation process, and we suppose that this process will is the future of cannabis extraction industry. CBD products have already spreaded across the market and its influence is indisputable on the niche of natural treatments. \n\nEven if you have as much knowledge on CBD as it needs to comfortably [use](https://cbdspace.io/what-are-the-uses-of-cbd-will-it-work-for-me/) it on a daily basis, it’s never been bad to know a little more. We have already made an article on extraction of CBD, but the distillation requests an individual material. So, without any further ado, what is cannabis distillation and why is this method so superior among other?\n\n## What is cannabis distillate?\n\nFirst of all, distillation of cannabis refers to a process of purifying a liquid by heating or cooling. So, speaking simply, distillation process helps us create concentrates that are cleaner than others, because they’re simply cleaner on a molecular level. Moreover, it is believed that distillates are the most \\[Tooltip]potent\\[Tooltip] type of concentrates you can purchase on the market. \n\nSo, with the appearance of cannabis distillation, market has offered you a product of infinite potential, with the highest amount of cannabinoids, ultimately pure and versatile among other CBD and THC products. As we know, that cannabis products can be either high with THC or CBD, but what is an actual difference CBD and THC distillates, let’s figure it out in the next paragraph.\n\n## The difference between CBD and THC distillates. \n\nThe distillation process covers both THC and CBD derived either from marijuana or hemp, but what makes these distillates so valuable? First of all, cannabis in a form of distillate is the purest condition of it. Commonly, distillates from hemp contain about 80% of CBD in resulting product, as well as THC [derived from marijuana](https://cbdspace.io/hemp-vs-marijuana-derived-cbd-whats-the-difference/). \n\nAs for 20% left, they usually contain other cannabinoids, terpenes, and various plant materials, that are going to help achieve the [entourage effect](https://cbdspace.io/whole-plant-insight-what-is-the-entourage-effect/), and feel the full range extract power. So, distillates are concentrated very highly, and it makes them the most potent product on the market. \n\nYou may be using CBD or THC for whatever reason, though with distillate you can embody the best therapeutic potential out of it. We’ve already understood, that distillates are so fun to use, but how are they made, actually?\n\n## The mechanism of making cannabis distillate.\n\nBoth CBD and THC distillates are made differently than other products like crystalline powders, waxes, etc. Before any distillation, we should extract needed materials from the hemp or marijuana plant. At this point, companies choose between various techniques of CBD and THC extraction. \n\nThe general concept of any cannabis extraction method is to make solvent pass through plant material in order to separate needed active compounds from the plant materials. \n\nSo, in order to create different products we should use different extraction methods, and here they are:\n\n***CO2 Extraction.***\n\nThis extraction is widely known as an excellent method to produce CBD-rich extracts. The concept of this method is to put carbon dioxide under high pressure while maintaining a low temperature. So, the gas is transformed into a liquid due to the high pressure to pass through the plant material with nearly 90% efficiency. The resulting substance is highly concentrated and pure. \n\nHowever, this extraction method is quite expensive and requires extensive equipment to work with. So, when it becomes a final CBD product, it is usually higher priced than others, because of the extraction method used, but you can be verified, that the quality of a product purchased will be on the highest level possible. \n\n***Ethanol Extraction.*** \n\nIn contrast to previous method, ethanol extraction is much lower-cost method, but is often used by various companies. In order to create the highest quality products with this method, it’s going to require much more expertise and post-extraction processing. \n\nThis extraction method uses an alcohol solvent - ethanol. Ethanol is a polar solvent, which means it will mix with water and dissolve water-soluble molecules in addition to extraction of primary compounds. This method helps to extract chlorophyll alongside with other compounds. The problem is, that if we want to get rid of chlorophyll, we should do some extra steps, where we can lose some amount of our cannabinoids.\n\nWe may say, if we want to produce the highest quality extract with this method, the operator and extractor should be as experienced as possible, because via using ethanol extraction being not experienced enough, there will be errors and possibility of resulting lower quality product.\n\n***Hydrocarbon Extraction.*** \n\nThis was an early option to extract from hemp. Hydrocarbons like butane, pentane, propane, hexane, isopropyl alcohol or acetone were used as a solvent for hemp extraction. Simply put, people used it, because these hydrocarbons have low boiling point, which makes them ideal for CBD hemp oil extraction. \n\nThe point is, that this method is very cheap and quite easy. However, it isn’t ideal at all. It is a common for this method to see resulting substances without proper amounts of terpenes, or CBD, and high amounts of THC instead. \n\nFurthermore, some solvent remains can be found in a resulting substance, so the can affect your immune system in time. That’s why it is rarely used nowadays and considered as a pretty dangerous method to produce CBD product. Thus, be aware.\n\n***Lipid Extraction.*** \n\nThis one is rarely used and is called lipid extraction. This method uses the “lipids” or simply fats to absorb and encapsulate hemp compounds. This extraction method often uses coconut organic oil, and it doesn’t require any dangerous solvents or even CO2. It is not used commonly, nonetheless you may find products done by using this extraction method.\n\nSo, when the extraction is finally done, and separated from other unwanted plant materials, we should fully isolate our primary cannabinoids CBD and THC. In that case, we may use the process called winterization. \n\nThis method utilizes the so called ethanol to excess all the unwanted materials left in a cold environment. During the process, crude extract and ethanol are being filtrated, and after that ethanol is being removed.\n\nThe next step in our extraction trip is decarboxylation, or you may call it the compound activation. As you probably know, cannabinoids that we extract come firstly in acid form, and in order to produce needed molecules, they should be activated first. For example, \\[Tooltip]CBDA\\[Tooltip] should be activated in order to produce CBD. \n\nSo, to activate these acids, all the extract should undergo the process called decarboxylation. Simply put, heat the extract. While being heaten up, the acid molecule is removed and the active compound is produced. \n\nFinally, after many steps of extraction, winterization and decarboxylation, we can get to the distillation point. During this process our substance is being put in a short part fractional or steam distillation chamber several times to clarify the cannabinoids needed into the purest, [isolated](https://cbdspace.io/what-are-cbd-isolates-what-are-they-good-for/) state. \n\nDepending on the distillation technique, compounds can be fractionated by themselves or collected together. The final product of cannabis distillation is a sap, that looks similar to very refined honey. After that it can be either mixed with other compounds or used as an oil to achieve all the therapeutic goals with it. \n\nTo the moment, we already understand, that distillate is the supreme way to consume CBD or THC, but what are its actual strengths and weaknesses?\n\n## Strengths and weaknesses of using cannabis distillate.\n\nLet’s start with the ultimate advantages of cannabis distillate. First of all, it is presumably one of the most potent forms of cannabinoid production you may purchase from the market. Alongside with this, you can simply use much less of the product due to its supreme potency. \n\nAnother great advantage is that you can use it in various [forms](https://cbdspace.io/how-do-i-take-cbd/), even in its distillate form, because it’s almost tasteless, but you also can mix it up with various compounds, flavors, edibles, used in a topicals for focused area relief, etc. to bring daily cannabis usage to another level. \n\nAs for its weak parts, even if it is one of the most potent and concentrated products on the market, it lacks many of other helpful cannabis compounds that should synergize with each other to produce the \\[Tooltip]entourage effect\\[Tooltip], because of many extraction steps used during the manufacture process. \n\nHowever, it’s only increasing the popularity, so it is only a matter of time till we can see the products without serious drawbacks.\n\n## Bottom line. \n\nEven when new products hit their popularity, it doesn’t mean that you should instantly go and buy them. We create our guides and articles only in educational purpose and don’t force any of you to start using CBD or other products. We hope, that this material would be helpful to you as an additional knowledge on the topic. \n\nDon’t forget to visit your doctor or pharmacist first before making any decisions. Your health must be your biggest concern. Stay tuned for more guides and don’t forget to share if you liked.",
