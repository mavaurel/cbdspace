  "content": "The whole new CBD industry is on its peak at the moment. Since the 2018 farm bill came in, that allowed producing and selling hemp products on the territory of the United States, the diversity of CBD products flooded the stalls of your favorite stores. Everything from various oils, creams, lotions, to vape liquids and edibles of all kinds are available for consumers, and even specific CBD stores were opened for your demands. \n\nIn the meantime, the overall trend on CBD only increased, and there are some straight reasons for it. First of all is the therapeutic potential found in compound, that is promising to become an excellent supplement for your daily life or even a standalone treatment for certain issues like [anxiety](/does-cbd-work-for-anxiety/), depression, skin problems, [pain](/does-cbd-help-with-pain/) of some kinds, and heart-related problems, and that’s not all the benefits. \n\nTons of scientists and researchers are trying to discover the full potential of CBD, and many studies are floating on the internet. The second main reason to try CBD is the abundance of different products on the market and their accessibility. However, there are still many questions about CBD from you, and in our articles we try to share with you all information and give you some answers to them. \n\nAs for now, the subject of this article is frequent question “What’s the difference between marijuana and hemp derived CBD?”. To answer this question, we should determine some commons first, starting with understanding what are hemp and marijuana in general?\n\n### What are the hemp and marijuana, is there any difference?\n\nGenerally, both hemp and marijuana are parts of the whole big cannabis family. Cannabis is a word to describe all plants of cannabaceae genus. This family consists of three primary species: cannabis indica, cannabis sativa, and cannabis ruderalis. \n\nThose, who are familiar with marijuana and hemp know, that both of them aren’t really strains, but the parts of some large cannabis classification. To understand, what’s the difference between marijuana and hemp, we should explore what these words actually mean and how we can relate it to cannabis without being misinformed? \n\n## Marijuana\n\nWe commonly use term “marijuana” to describe a species of cannabis, that contains THC more than 0,3% in it, provides psychoactive properties and can easily get you to the altered state(speaking simply, get you high). Speaking history, the word marijuana is a negative representation of cannabis, because it is connected with Mexican revolution and this word was used to differentiate Mexican cannabis from other. \n\nSo, any person who is in the industry, won’t use the word, even calling it racist. To that moment, cannabis was legal, but after passing of marijuana tax act<sup id=\"ref_1\">[1](#note_1)</sup>, it was banned for the next 80 years by the federal laws of the United States. \n\nBroadly speaking, in our daily life we use the word marijuana for cannabis, that contains much THC in it and may cause psychotropic or euphoric effect. Furthermore, it is still federally illegal to grow and sell marijuana, because it is being regulated by a controlled substance act, but some states made it legal since that moment. \n\n## Hemp\n\nWe use the term “hemp” to describe a species of cannabis as well, but the one, that contains less than 0,3% THC in it. Since the 2018 farm bill had passed, hemp became legal for producing and selling on the territory of the United States. As for real definition, the term hemp is being used to describe all non-intoxicating species of cannabis family, that can be grown by licensed growers for the industrial use of its derived product.  Hemp was discovered nearly 10000 years ago and was harvested to produce many kinds of different products - ropes, building materials, textiles, food, clothing and much more. This strong resource is being used in many industries, and hemp derived CBD, for example is one of the most popular natural treatments across the world at the moment.\n\nNow we know a little more about these two, and can advance a bit. The next thing to understand and get common with is CBD and its work in general. Let’s figure it out!\n\n#### What is CBD and how does it work?\n\nFirst of all, CBD abbreviation stands short for cannabidiol and represents one of the primary compounds found in cannabis plant. As for his nearest cousins, you have probably heard of THC, the primary psychoactive compound of cannabis. Unlike THC, CBD can’t get you to the “high” state no matter how much and how long you use, because it just works differently. CBD is usually being extracted from the hemp flower, which is only legal in the U.S. if the amount of THC in it not higher than 0,3%, so, officially, it cannot get you to the altered state in any ways. \n\nIt can be consumed in various [forms](/how-do-i-take-cbd/). For example, you may inhale it by vaping CBD hemp infused liquids, or eat infused edibles like gummy bears or pills, or even take it topically with creams and lotions, but the most popular method across users is taking it [sublingually](/what-is-sublingual-cbd-an-essential-guide/), getting special tinctures under your tongue. It is clear, you may choose any of it depending on your demands and reasons, but how does it work in general?\n\nEvery one of us has its own endocannabinoid system(ECS), which is a complex of receptors giving signals to our body and produces cannabinoids to maintain homeostasis and our overall wellness. The ECS is responsible for regulation of many functions in our body: immunity, mood, memory, appetite, etc. For example, the thing known as “runner’s high” is a result of working ECS. \n\nEndocannabinoid system has receptors, that either CBD or THC interact with, CB1 and CB2. Unlike THC, CBD due to its shape doesn’t try to replace our natural hormones called anandamide, but just binds to these receptors producing much more cannabinoids to maintain our natural body rhythms. The exact ways of how CB1 and CB2 receptors affect on our brains isn’t fully understood so there are still more to study and research. While it is clear, that CBD can be either marijuana or hemp derived, but what’s the actual difference between them?\n\n### What is the actual difference between hemp and marijuana derived CBD?\n\nWe already know, that CBD can be produced from both hemp and marijuana plants, but they are not going to be similar in the end. Hemp derived CBD takes its way directly from an industrial hemp plant, that is produced for its fiber and seeds. It differs from marijuana even in its appearance - hemp plants are visually skinnier than marijuana and has much rare leaves than its cousin. \n\nOther than appearance, the biggest difference is concentration of THC in it - according to the federal law, it must be lower than 0.3%. In contrast, marijuana derived CBD is extracted from a marijuana plant, that is usually produced for its psychoactive properties. It is much thicker, and the foliage is much richer than hemp. THC is the primary cannabinoid of the plant, but there are some strains that provide a large amount of CBD as well. \n\nThe molecular structure of CBD is the same, no matter which plant derived it. However, there are some critical points in differentiating one from another. First point is resin, containing in both products. Cannabis resin is usually found in buds and trichomes of the plant, and lesser in the foliage. \n\nMarijuana plants is much richer when it comes to a resin, so it is a quite bountiful source of CBD, while hemp needs larger quantities to extract CBD from it. However, industry is growing, and this problem was solved by creating some new strains of hemp with the amount of CBD from 12 to 20 percent, without increasing the potency of THC. This is an incredibly high concentration, so to say. \n\nThe last, but not the least important thing is contamination. Due to the bad regulations on the cannabis market in general, it is hard to guess, was your CBD made of a pure plant without any chemicals or not. \n\nFortunately, hemp growing industry is under a federal regulation and in most of the cases, it is safer to consume hemp derived CBD in order to avoid risks of contamination. So, that are is the primary differences between hemp and marijuana derived CBD products, but we understand, that it is still hard to choose and going to make advice. \n\n### Which one is right for me?\n\nUnfortunately, there are no credibly best options, because natural treatments like CBD or THC are quite individual things and the results may vary one from another. If you would like to try either CBD or THC, we strongly recommend visiting doctor or pharmacist first, because specialists know better.  As for THC, marijuana can even be illegal in your area, so it is gonna be better consulting with a specialist first, in order to avoid any troubles. Even if you know that CBD is a safe product, it may interact with your daily medication, and cause some temporary side effects. It is your only health, and nobody should care more than you about it.",
