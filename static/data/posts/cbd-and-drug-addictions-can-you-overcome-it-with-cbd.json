  "content": "It is not a secret for any of you, that CBD is on its peak of fame at the moment, and that’s why there are so many products and consume [options](https://cbdspace.io/how-do-i-take-cbd/) available for you. However, there are still many of you who didn’t know anything about CBD and why is it so popular. \n\nSimply put, when the [2018 farm bill](https://cbdspace.io/2018-farm-bill-and-what-it-means-for-cbd-industry/) came in, manufacturing of hemp and its products were legalized on the territory of the United States, but only for licensed growers and if the amount of THC in the plant doesn’t exceed 0.3%. \n\nAfter that, many scientists and experts continued their researches on CBD and when \\[Tooltip]FDA\\[Tooltip] approved first CBD based epilepsy treatment called Epidiolex, other products almost instantly flooded the market, and even the one person, who’s only going groceries once a week sees something with CBD on the stalls of the store. \n\nSo, the studies on CBD are still going on, because not all the potential [benefits](https://cbdspace.io/cbd-benefits-and-side-effects/) have been discovered yet. Nonetheless, experts always try to find new opportunities for CBD to come into our daily life. One of the suggestions is that CBD might become a good option in case of treating substance addictions. Every day, colossal amount of people across the U.S. and other parts of the world from various addictions, starting with opioid addiction, and ending with alcohol. \n\nWhile the number of deaths is so big, government and other facilities are trying to help every person who’s suffering from addiction by easing access to special recovery centers, and of course treatment options. Before we’ll talk on how CBD can become a better replacement for usual treatment methods, we should first look at the problem itself and understand what generally substance addiction is and why common treatment methods aren’t as effective as they could be?\n\n## Basics of substance addiction and what is the common treatment for it?\n\nFirst of all, what does any drug addiction look like? It’s a complex disease, that affects both mind and body, and it is mostly being presented as a brain disease, because any heavy drug use leads to change of its structure and brings the chaos in overall work of brain. \n\nPeople, who are affected by addiction often feel themselves like a fish out of water, and like they cannot function normally without another dose of drug, pint of beer, or any other. Unfortunately, addictions are chronic, long-lasting, and very progressive, which can lead to a wide range of results, starting with complication of relationships, and ending with fatal results. \n\nIt means, that without proper treatment, any addiction can easily lead to death. Usually, these addictions are being treated by many options, because in most cases there is no one and only successful medicine or method treat addiction, because they’re as different as the people who addicted to them are. However, it doesn’t mean we won’t name some of them. \n\nCommonly, most places may start with behavioral counseling, which means, that in not heavy cases you will visit a specialist that is ready to help you whatever you addicted to. The next one is of course medication, because it usually helps to treat some strong symptoms, but it’s actually not an option for everybody. The rest methods mostly consist of different therapies, devices and applications that are used to treat several forms of addiction. \n\nWhat about CBD? How it can help with certain addictions, or even become an alternative treatment for them? That’s a good question, and beforehand we only can say, that increasing research on CBD achieves some goals, that’s why from time to time we see new possible methods of CBD use.\n\n## So, could CBD become an alternative for addiction treatment?\n\nWhile any other traditional methods will always be the case, there should be a place for new methods, that can possibly work for certain types of addiction. However, only plenty of rehab clinics and treatment methods have shown their effectiveness, so we understand that the system doesn’t work well enough to handle all the issues. \n\nThe number of deaths caused by overdose or heavy drug abuse grows day by day, and it means, that modern times require all the methods exist to handle the cases, and anyone who suffers from drug dependency deserves a proper attitude and of course to know every method they can use to reduce symptoms or even recover from dependency.\n\nAs for CBD, it is not an official treatment method, but only a suggestion, that it can help with this is kinda promising, so we don’t wanna leave it like that. That’s why we need to get a bit deeper into this topic and understand how exactly it would help those of us who suffer from addictions. So, how does CBD work in case of dependency?\n\n## How CBD works in case of addictions and what do the study say?\n\nWe started to see lots of both personal reviews and research of CBD effectiveness over certain addictions. Of course, there is no way it can magically cure the dependency, as well as other conditions like cancer, but it can certainly help with reducing symptoms, and we’re going to show you how.\n\nGenerally, any influence of CBD on our body starts with endocannabinoid system. Many researches show, that [endocannabinoid system](https://cbdspace.io/what-is-endocannabinoid-system-and-how-it-works-with-cbd/) plays a key role in balancing your natural body rhythms and other primary aspects of our body like immune system, nervous system, cardiovascular, and the ECS itself located in most parts of our body as well, so it isn’t necessary to say how important the role of endocannabinoid system is. Speaking simply, experts suggest CBD for treating addictions, because it’s rather beneficial in balancing the endocannabinoid system. \n\nNow let’s talk a bit about how to fight an addiction, because everything starts with overcoming it. Once the withdrawal period is over, it’s very important to control the cravings that usually lead to relapse, but what does actually craving means, what happens in our bodies when craving comes? \n\nIt’s been discovered recently, that cravings caused by substance abuse lead to increased transmission of the \\[Tooltip]neurotransmitter\\[Tooltip] called glutamate, that is located throughout the brain and spinal cord, and responsible for such body functions as memory and immune system. \n\nHowever, we didn’t find any firm studies on how the direct consume of CBD impacts on the transmission of glutamate, but the thing we know for sure, is that CBD has neuroprotective, antidepressant, anxiolytic and [antipsychotic](https://cbdspace.io/cbds-antipsychotic-potential/) properties, and so forth, causes a protective effect on glutamate toxicity.\n\nThat’s all clear, but these are just words, what is the actual research? In former research it was shown that CBD is involved in both recovery and craving behavior. This study examined behavior of lab rats on the self-administration and their drug seeking. While not any self administration factors were altered, CBD surely reduced their drug seeking cravings by balancing their endocannabinoid system, that’s why the study resulted with a suggestion that CBD could become a potential alternative treatment for cravings and relapse. \n\nSpeaking of other addictions like tobacco, there was a study, that increased attention over the effectiveness of CBD as a supplement that helped quit smoking. Simply put, it indicated that CBD contains a cannabinoid that helped to reduce development of so called \\[Tooltip]cues\\[Tooltip].  \n\nFurthermore, CBD is presented to have an ability to regulate emotion levels and emotional memory generation. So to say, that was the leading suggestion of why CBD should be helpful with treating not only substance abuse disorders, but [anxiety and depression](https://cbdspace.io/does-cbd-work-for-anxiety/) as well. \n\nThat is the key point in helping people who suffer from dependency and drug abuse disorders, because CBD reduces the generation of drug memories, and interrupts activation of existing memories from the past. It is the primary benefit, that could be useful for people to change their rehab process. \n\nHowever, we’re still lacking of proper research on that topic, but this is only the first brick in the house of full CBD potential, and we’re ready to give you the newest information as fast as possible.\n\nIf you are still reading this, it’s not the end of our discussion for today. We’re already observed heavy cases of drug dependence, but what about for example habitual cannabis users, who want to take a break during their smoking sessions. Would CBD be good for that purpose?\n\n## What is the tolerance break and how CBD could help in that case?\n\nSpeaking simply, tolerance break, in case of cannabis, THC tolerance break is just a practice of taking a break from THC using, in order to detoxify mind and body from the long lasting effects of this psychoactive compound. Unlike CBD use, people, who are using THC daily are likely to build up a \\[Tooltip]tolerance\\[Tooltip] to it. \n\nBasically, habitual consumer’s body adapts to the changes in ECS, and they wouldn’t feel the same effects of cannabinoid as they previously were. The more you smoke, less effect would be generated, but how CBD can help with it? The answer is pretty easy - CBD just works other way. Instead of mimicking our natural endocannabinoids and regulating it by itself, CBD just binds to the endocannabinoid receptors to help balance it and maintain \\[Tooltip]homeostasis\\[Tooltip]. What does that mean, actually? It means that CBD would be a good replacement for THC during this time, because of two simple things. \n\nThe first one is that you don’t need to try replacing you habit with any other activity, but just smoke CBD instead of regular marijuana, or use it in any other form, so that won’t disturb your habits, but only help feel less stressful. Other primary thing is that CBD can help reduce the time of your tolerance break by normalizing your natural body rhythms and regulating everything that had a negative effect from THC.\n\nHowever, it doesn’t mean, that THC wouldn’t affect your body at all. It’s still a dangerous substance, that changes your body functions on every level and alters your mind, so you should be firstly paying attention to your health, because as we’ve said earlier, heavy THC use can lead to certain things and most importantly - to a substance addiction, so be aware. \n\n## Bottom line.  \n\nEven when we think that we know enough about a certain supplement, it doesn’t mean we should instantly start using it. Nobody but specialist know what is necessary to do with your body, and what is not. \n\nSo, if you are interested in trying CBD for whatever purpose, talk with your pharmacist or doctor first, because even if CBD doesn’t have any crucial side effects, it still can [interact](https://cbdspace.io/cbd-and-drug-interactions-is-it-dangerous/) with your daily medication. Moreover, every body reacts on that supplement differently, so it is highly recommended recording everything when you start using it. \n\nSpeaking of our material, we’re not forcing anybody to start using CBD or THC, but just giving you educational material, that should be useful for your sle research and overall knowledge.
