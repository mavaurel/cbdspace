  "content": "It is not a secret for any of you, that CBD is on its peak of fame at the moment, and that’s why there are so many products and consume [options](https://cbdspace.io/how-do-i-take-cbd/) available for you. However, there are still many of you who didn’t know anything about CBD and why is it so popular. \n\nSimply put, when the [2018 farm bill](https://cbdspace.io/2018-farm-bill-and-what-it-means-for-cbd-industry/) came in, manufacturing of hemp and its products were legalized on the territory of the United States, but only for licensed growers and if the amount of THC in the plant doesn’t exceed 0.3%. \n\nAfter that, many scientists and experts continued their researches on CBD and when \\[Tooltip]FDA\\[Tooltip] approved first CBD based epilepsy treatment called Epidiolex, other products almost instantly flooded the market, and even the one person, who’s only going groceries once a week sees something with CBD on the stalls of the store. \n\nSo, the studies on CBD are still going on, because not all the potential [benefits](https://cbdspace.io/cbd-benefits-and-side-effects/) have been discovered yet. Nonetheless, it was discussed between experts, that endocannabinoid system dysfunction can lead to development of psychotic disorders. \n\nWith that being said, some started to hold promise on CBD to become brand new antipsychotic option. While that is only a suggestion, we should take a better look on some firm material in order to understand even is this a possible option or not. So, first things first, let’s learn what a psychotic disorder is, and why is it a noticeable problem for modern society?\n\n## What is psychotic disorder?\n\nGenerally, any psychotic disorder cause an individual to lose touch with reality, and is the most diverse type of mental illnesses exist. As for most common symptoms of psychotic disorders, there are two main cases, that include hallucinations, and [Tooltip]delusions[Tooltip]. \n\nAs for most prevalent conditions, connected with psychotic disorders, we may name schizophrenia as one of the most frequent psychotic disorders. Some individuals, who suffer from \\[Tooltip]bipolar disorder\\[Tooltip] may also have some symptoms associated with psychosis. Although, there are much more factors that can lead to psychotic disorders such as drug or alcohol addictions, brain tumors, etc. \n\nSpeaking of schizophrenia, more than 20 million people around the globe are affected by it, and more than half of that number doesn’t receive a proper care. For other mental disorders, according to \\[Tooltip]WHO\\[Tooltip], one in four people worldwide will be affected by some kind of mental disorder during their lifetime. \n\nThe main problem lies in the treatment, because even when people are getting appropriate attitude to their issue, it doesn’t mean they end suffering from them, but only some symptoms are getting subsided. So, now we should discuss different forms of antipsychotic treatment and understand why is it necessary to find another option for people, who are living with these conditions.\n\n## General forms of antipsychotic treatment and why is it necessary to find replacement for them?\n\nWhen it comes to treating psychotic disorders, it is common to see prescribed medication as an antipsychotic treatment. The main concept of this therapy is to control dopamine levels in your brain by consuming this kind of medication. However, with the benefits always come some drawbacks. \n\nThe primary idea of why this medicine isn’t good enough lies in the fact, that prescription medicine has a list of quite disturbing negative side effects, and people with psychotic disorders are afraid of using prescribed pill because of the side effects they bring alongside. The most frequent side effects known are restlessness, low blood pressure, dry mouth, vomiting, nausea, dizziness, constipation, seizures, weight gain and more. \n\nWe guess, that you’ve got the idea of why usual antipsychotic treatment is so questionable and people with certain conditions are hesitant to it. Nonetheless, modern problems require modern solutions, and as time goes, new opportunities are being discovered. For now, CBD shows a potential to become an antipsychotic drug, and to understand why, let’s have a little research. \n\n## What is CBD potential in case of antipsychotic treatment?\n\nWe already know, that cannabis is sometimes used to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, but unfortunately, according to various studies it was reported, that heavy use of high THC strains of cannabis only makes the situation worse, even can lead to development of psychotic disorders. \n\nHowever, that’s only being said about high THC strains of cannabis. In contrast, CDB seems to do exactly the opposite things with your body. While there are many studies that discover CBD potential in different cases, it’s been presented that it might be helpful with reducing symptoms associated with psychotic disorders. \n\nThis study<sup>[1](#note_1)</sup> observes the habitual use of cannabis and says that THC is a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. In contrast, here CBD appears as a zero psychotomimetic option, that seems to have positive antipsychotic effects in animal models. \n\nSo, it appears, that CBD might become a better option for those who are afraid to use prescribed medicine in case of psychotic conditions. Is it really so? Let’s get deeper and see how it actually works!\n\n## How CBD works in case of psychotic disorders?\n\nNot so long ago, there were some studies indicated that in people with psychotic disorders CBD has a big antipsychotic effect that can be compared to some usual prescribed drugs. So, what’s the point, how CBD actually helped these people to reduce symptoms? \n\nSimply put, the improvement of psychosis symptoms is connected with increased levels of \\[Tooltip]anandamide\\[Tooltip]. It also means, that in contrast, when your ECS is dysfunctional and doesn’t produce enough endocannabinoids to maintain homeostasis and this may lead to development of psychotic disorders. \n\nWhat’s more, it’s also been reported that CBD can potentially improve glucose metabolism and some disturbances connected mostly with schizophrenia. Furthermore, CBD also stops anandamide degradation associated with psychotic disorders and ECS dysfunction. \n\nWith all that being said, it’s still only just words and some double-blinded studies, but what about real cases of using CDB in case of psychotic disorders? We’ve collected some material on CBD and schizophrenia in order to answer some more questions in our very next paragraph.\n\n## Proper studies on CBD as an antipsychotic option.\n\nThe first study<sup>[2](#note_2)</sup> on that case was in far 1995. To be short, this study showed that daily use of 1500mg CBD for 4 weeks straight improved overall psychotic symptoms. \n\nThe second one<sup>[3](#note_3)</sup> took place in 2006 and was kind of small in case of patients(there were three of them, so to say). That one presented, that both benefits and side symptoms were increased during the experiment. However, no side effects of CBD were involved in this.\n\nThe next one is that found CBD has antipsychotic properties compared to some common medication, that is used in case of psychotic conditions. In contrast to this medication, CBD did not present large side effects, but only showed that it cannot cause weight gain, restlessness, uncontrollable movements, and other negative side effects that usually come alongside with these drugs.  \n\nSo, we may conclude, that these studies hold a promise on CDB as an antipsychotic option instead of other common medications, but of course this is only beginning, and it’s no time to have firm answers on should you use CDB in that case or not. \n\n## Bottom line.\n\nEven you think you have enough knowledge on CBD, it doesn’t mean you should instantly start using it without proper advice from a doctor\\pharmacist. We are not forcing anybody to start using CBD, but giving you as much useful material as possible. The [regulation on the market](https://cbdspace.io/how-to-choose-safe-and-approved-cbd-product/) and proper study on CBD aren’t good enough, so we personally recommend asking for a guidance from a specialist, because CBDSpace team is just researching materials that are available on the internet, and of course we can make some mistakes during our researches. We hope that our guides and articles would be helpful to you on the way of CBD discovery. Stay tuned for more guides and don’t forget to share if you liked, because any material we create is made for you in educational purpose.",
